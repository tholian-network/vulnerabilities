  "type": "privilege escalation",
  "severity": "High",
  "vector": "Local",
  "description": "A use-after-free vulnerability has been discovered in the DCCP implementation in the Linux kernel. The dccp_rcv_state_process function in net/dccp/input.c in the Linux kernel through 4.9.11 mishandles DCCP_PKT_REQUEST packet data structures in the LISTEN state. A local unprivileged user could use this flaw to alter the kernel memory, allowing them to escalate their privileges on the system via an application that makes an IPV6_RECVPKTINFO setsockopt system call.",
