	"name": "CVE-2020-35501",
	"type": "insufficient validation",
	"severity": "Low",
	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "A security issue was found in the Linux kernel. The open_by_handle_at syscall is not covered by the current file watch implementation of Auditd. This allows a local attacker with elevated privileges (CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH capability) to read and modify files without being noticed by the implemented Auditd file watches.\r\n\r\nThis syscall can still be audited by using the 'syscall auditing feature' by passing open_by_handle_at to it in the rule.  Existing auditing ruleset requirements generally use this mechanism.",
