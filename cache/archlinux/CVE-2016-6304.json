{
  "name": "CVE-2016-6304",
  "type": "denial of service",
  "severity": "High",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "A malicious client can send an excessively large OCSP Status Request extension. If that client continually requests renegotiation, sending a large OCSP Status Request extension each time, then there will be unbounded memory growth on the server. This will eventually lead to a Denial Of Service attack through memory exhaustion. Servers with a default configuration are vulnerable even if they do not support OCSP. Builds using the \"no-ocsp\" build time option are not affected.",
