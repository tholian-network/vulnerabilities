  "name": "CVE-2021-32762",
  "type": "arbitrary code execution",
  "severity": "High",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "The redis-cli command line tool and redis-sentinel service may be vulnerable to integer overflow when parsing specially crafted large multi-bulk network replies. This is a result of a vulnerability in the underlying hiredis library which does not perform an overflow check before calling the calloc() heap allocation function.\r\n\r\nThis issue only impacts systems with heap allocators that do not perform their own overflow checks. Most modern systems do and are therefore not likely to be affected. Furthermore, by default redis-sentinel uses the jemalloc allocator which is also not vulnerable.\r\n\r\nThe problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14.",
