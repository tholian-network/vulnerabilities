  "name": "CVE-2016-6306",
  "type": "denial of service",
  "severity": "Low",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "In OpenSSL 1.0.2 and earlier some missing message length checks can result in OOB reads of up to 2 bytes beyond an allocated buffer. There is a theoretical DoS risk but this has not been observed in practice on common platforms.\nThe messages affected are client certificate, client certificate request and server certificate. As a result the attack can only be performed against a client or a server which enables client authentication.",
