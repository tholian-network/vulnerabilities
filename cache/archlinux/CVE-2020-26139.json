	"type": "insufficient validation",
	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before version 5.12.9. An Access Point (AP) forwards EAPOL frames to other clients even though the sender has not yet successfully authenticated to the AP. This might be abused in projected Wi-Fi networks to launch denial-of-service attacks against connected clients and makes it easier to exploit other vulnerabilities in connected clients.",
