	"notes": "The JFS kernel module witll be autoloaded when a JFS filesystem is in use, its use can be disabled by preventing the module from loading with the following instructions:\r\n\r\n# echo \"blacklist jfs\" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\r\n\r\nThe system will need to be restarted if the JFS module are loaded. In most circumstances, the CIFS kernel modules will be unable to be unloaded while any jfs filesystems are in use."
