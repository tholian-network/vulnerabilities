	"type": "denial of service",
	"severity": "Low",
	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "A security issue has been found in TensorFlow before version 2.4.2. The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.FractionalMaxPoolGrad` triggers an undefined behavior if one of the input tensors is empty. The code is also vulnerable to a denial of service attack as a `CHECK` condition becomes false and aborts the process. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/169054888d50ce488dfde9ca55d91d6325efbd5b/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_max_pool_op.cc#L215) fails to validate that input and output tensors are not empty and are of the same rank. Each of these unchecked assumptions is responsible for the above issues.",
