  "type": "denial of service",
  "severity": "Low",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "A security issue has been found in Go before version 1.16.6. crypto/tls clients can panic when provided a certificate of the wrong type for the negotiated parameters. net/http clients performing HTTPS requests are also affected. The panic can be triggered by an attacker in a privileged network position without access to the server certificate's private key, as long as a trusted ECDSA or Ed25519 certificate for the server exists (or can be issued), or the client is configured with Config.InsecureSkipVerify. Clients that disable all TLS_RSA cipher suites (that is, TLS 1.0\u20131.2 cipher suites without ECDHE), as well as TLS 1.3-only clients, are unaffected.",
