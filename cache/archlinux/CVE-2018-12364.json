  "severity": "High",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "A security issue has been found in Firefox before 61.0 and Thunderbird before 52.9, where NPAPI plugins, such as Adobe Flash, can send non-simple cross-origin requests, bypassing CORS by making a same-origin POST that does a 307 redirect to the target site. This allows for a malicious site to engage in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.",
