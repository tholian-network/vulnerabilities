  "name": "CVE-2020-25685",
  "type": "insufficient validation",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "When getting a reply from a forwarded query, dnsmasq before version 2.83 checks in forward.c:reply_query() which one is the forwarded query that matches the reply by only using a weak hash of the query name. Due to the weak hash (CRC32 when dnsmasq is compiled without DNSSEC, SHA-1 when it is) an off-path attacker can find several different domains all having the same hash, substantially reducing the number of attempts he would have to perform to forge a reply and get it accepted by dnsmasq. This is in contrast with RFC5452, which specifies that query name is one of the attributes of a query that must be used to match a reply. This flaw could be abused to perform a DNS Cache Poisoning attack. If chained with CVE-2020-25684 the attack complexity of a successful attack is reduced.",
