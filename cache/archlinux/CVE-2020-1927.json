  "severity": "Low",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "A security issue has been found in Apache HTTP Server from 2.4.0 up to and including 2.4.41, in the mod_rewrite module, where redirects that were intended to be self-referential might be fooled by encoded newlines and redirect instead to an an unexpected URL within the request URL.\r\nThis is the same defect as CVE-2019-10098. The fix for CVE-2019-10098 was ineffective.\r\nPossible mitigations are the use of anchor captures as back-references, or prefixing self-referential redirects with / or scheme, host, and port.",
