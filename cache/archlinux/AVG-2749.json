  "notes": "didn't add CVE-2021-46790 (CVSS 9.8) because `ntfsck` is not provided by `ntfs-3g`, although I yet have to check wether it was present in the previous version or removed when it was deprecated\r\n\r\nTODO: look up wether ntfs-3g is built with the internal libfuse or not as it determines wether the second advisory applies"
