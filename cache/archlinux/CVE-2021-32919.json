  "name": "CVE-2021-32919",
  "type": "authentication bypass",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "A security issue was found in the Prosody.im XMPP server software before version 0.11.9. The undocumented option \u2018dialback_without_dialback\u2019 enabled an experimental feature for server-to-server authentication. A flaw in this feature meant it did not correctly authenticate remote servers, allowing a remote server to impersonate another server when this option is enabled.",
