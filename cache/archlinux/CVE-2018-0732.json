  "name": "CVE-2018-0732",
  "type": "denial of service",
  "severity": "Low",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "During key agreement in a TLS handshake using a DH(E) based ciphersuite a malicious server can send a very large prime value to the client. This will cause the client to spend an unreasonably long period of time generating a key for this prime resulting in a hang until the client has finished. This could be exploited in a Denial Of Service attack.",
