  "name": "CVE-2021-3580",
  "type": "denial of service",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "Multiple issues were found with Nettle's RSA decryption functions before version 3.7.3. These can be triggered by providing manipulated ciphertext and could lead to application crash and denial of service. Since nettle is used with gnuTLS, there is a possibility that a remote client could crash a server compiled with gnuTLS when RSA is used for the initial key exchange.",
