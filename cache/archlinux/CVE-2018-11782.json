  "name": "CVE-2018-11782",
  "type": "denial of service",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "Subversion svn:// connections, including svn+ssh:// and svn+<custom>://, use a custom network protocol [1] with Lisp-like syntax. The code implementing the protocol has dedicated codepaths for serialization of revision numbers into protocol integers.  A particular client query could cause the server to attempt to reply with a revision number whose value is the invalid revision number constant `SVN_INVALID_REVNUM`, thereby triggering an assertion failure in the the serialization layer.",
