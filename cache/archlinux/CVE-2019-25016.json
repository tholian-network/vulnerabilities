  "description": "A security issue has been found in OpenDoas before 6.8.1, where rules that allowed the user to execute any command would inherit the executing user's PATH instead of resetting it to a default PATH. Rules that limit the user to execute only a specific command are not affected by this and are only executed from the default PATH and with the PATH environment variable set to the safe default.",
