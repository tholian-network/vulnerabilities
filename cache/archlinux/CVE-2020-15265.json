  "name": "CVE-2020-15265",
  "type": "denial of service",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Local",
  "description": "In Tensorflow before version 2.4.0, an attacker can pass an invalid axis value to tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize. This results in accessing a dimension outside the rank of the input tensor in the C++ kernel implementation. However, dim_size only does a DCHECK to validate the argument and then uses it to access the corresponding element of an array. Since in normal builds, DCHECK-like macros are no-ops, this results in segfault and access out of bounds of the array.",
