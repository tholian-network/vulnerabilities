  "name": "CVE-2016-7045",
  "type": "arbitrary code execution",
  "severity": "High",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "The format_send_to_gui() function does not validate the length of the string before incrementing the `ptr' pointer in all cases.\nIf that happens, the pointer `ptr' can be incremented twice and thus end past the boundaries of the original `dup' buffer.\nRemote code execution might be difficult since only Nuls are written.",
