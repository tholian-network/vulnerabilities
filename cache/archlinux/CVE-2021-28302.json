  "type": "denial of service",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "A stack overflow in libupnp up to version 1.14.4 can cause denial of service through the Parser_parseDocument() function. ixmlNode_free() will release a child node recursively, which will consume stack space and lead to a crash. The issue is fixed in  libupnp version 1.14.5 by implementing ixmlNode_free() in a non-recursive way.",
