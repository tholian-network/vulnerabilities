  "name": "CVE-2018-11235",
  "type": "arbitrary code execution",
  "severity": "Critical",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "A security issue has been found in git before 2.17.1. With a crafted .gitmodules file, a malicious project can execute an arbitrary script on a machine that runs \"git clone --recurse-submodules\" because submodule \"names\" are obtained from this file, and then appended to $GIT_DIR/modules, leading to directory traversal with \"../\" in a name. Finally, post-checkout hooks from a submodule are executed, bypassing the intended design in which hooks are not obtained from a remote server.",
