  "name": "CVE-2021-22901",
  "type": "arbitrary code execution",
  "severity": "High",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "libcurl before version 7.77.0 can be tricked into using already freed memory when a new TLS session is negotiated or a client certificate is requested on an existing connection. For example, this can happen when a TLS server requests a client certificate on a connection that was established without one. A malicious server can use this in rare unfortunate circumstances to potentially reach remote code execution in the client. The flaw can only happen in libcurl built to use OpenSSL.",
