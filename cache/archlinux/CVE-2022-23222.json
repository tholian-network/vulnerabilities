  "notes": "The default kernels prevent unprivileged users from being able to use eBPF by the kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled sysctl. This would require a privileged user with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or root to be able to abuse this flaw reducing its attack space.\r\nTo confirm the current state, inspect the sysctl with the command:\r\n\r\n    cat /proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_bpf_disabled\r\n\r\nThe setting >=1 would mean that unprivileged users can not use eBPF, mitigating the flaw.\r\nA kernel update will be required to mitigate the flaw for root or users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capabilities."
