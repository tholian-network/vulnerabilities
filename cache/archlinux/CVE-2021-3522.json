	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "A security issue has been found in OpenJFX before version 8u312 in the javafx/media component. An easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise OpenJFX. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of OpenJFX as well as unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Java SE accessible data and unauthorized read access to a subset of OpenJFX accessible data.\r\n\r\nNote : This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator).",
