	"description": "In TensorFlow before version 2.6.1, the shape inference code for the Cudnn* operations in TensorFlow can be tricked into accessing invalid memory, via a heap buffer overflow. This occurs because the ranks of the input, input_h and input_c parameters are not validated, but code assumes they have certain values.",
