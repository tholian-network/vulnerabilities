	],
	"notes": "Workaround\r\n==========\r\n\r\nWhere the IMAP or POP3 server supports this form of access, fetchmail can be configured to use Implicit TLS, called \"ssl\" mode, meaning it will connect to a dedicated port (default: 993 for IMAP, 995 for POP3) and negotiate TLS without prior clear-text protocol exchange.\r\n\r\nAlso, --ssl can be given on the command line, which switches all configured server statements to this Implicit TLS mode."
