	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "A VMSF_DELTA memory corruption was discovered in unrar before 5.5.5, as used in Sophos Anti-Virus Threat Detection Engine before 3.37.2 and other products, that can lead to arbitrary code execution. An integer overflow can be caused in DataSize+CurChannel. The result is a negative value of the \"DestPos\" variable, which allows the attacker to write out of bounds when setting Mem[DestPos].",
