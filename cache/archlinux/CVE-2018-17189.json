  "description": "By sending request bodies in a slow loris way to plain resources, the h2 stream of Apache HTTP Server before 2.4.38 for that request unnecessarily occupied a server thread cleaning up that incoming data. This affects only HTTP/2 connections. A possible mitigation is to not enable the h2 protocol.",
