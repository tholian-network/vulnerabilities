	"name": "CVE-2021-41208",
	"type": "arbitrary code execution",
	"severity": "High",
	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "In TensorFlow before version 2.6.1, the code for boosted trees in TensorFlow is still missing validation. As a result, attackers can trigger denial of service (via dereferencing nullptrs or via CHECK-failures) as well as abuse undefined behavior (binding references to nullptrs). An attacker can also read and write from heap buffers, depending on the API that gets used and the arguments that are passed to the call. Given that the boosted trees implementation in TensorFlow is unmaintained, it is recommend to no longer use these APIs. TensorFlow's boosted trees APIs will be deprecated in subsequent releases.",
