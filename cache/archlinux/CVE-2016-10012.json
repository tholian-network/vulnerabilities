  "name": "CVE-2016-10012",
  "type": "insufficient validation",
  "severity": "Low",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "It was found that the shared memory manager used by pre-authentication compression support had a bounds checks that could be elided by some optimizing compilers. Additionally, this memory manager was incorrectly accessible when pre-authentication compression was disabled. This could potentially allow attacks against the privileged monitor process from the sandboxed privilege-separation process (a compromise of the latter would be required first).",
