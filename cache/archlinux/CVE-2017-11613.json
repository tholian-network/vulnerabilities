  "name": "CVE-2017-11613",
  "type": "denial of service",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "In LibTIFF before 4.0.10, there is a denial of service vulnerability in the TIFFOpen function triggered by resource consumption via crafted input files. During the TIFFOpen process, td_imagelength is not checked. The value of td_imagelength can be directly controlled by an input file. In the ChopUpSingleUncompressedStrip function, the _TIFFCheckMalloc function is called based on td_imagelength. If we set the value of td_imagelength close to the amount of system memory, it will hang the system or trigger the OOM killer.",
