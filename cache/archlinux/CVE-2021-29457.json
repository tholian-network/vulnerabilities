  "name": "CVE-2021-29457",
  "type": "arbitrary code execution",
  "severity": "Low",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "A heap buffer overflow was found in Exiv2 before version 0.27.4. The heap overflow is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to gain code execution, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file.\r\n\r\nNote that this bug is only triggered when _writing_ the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than _reading_ the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as insert.",
