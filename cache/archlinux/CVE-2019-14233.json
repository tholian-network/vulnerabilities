	"type": "denial of service",
	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "Due to the behavior of the underlying HTMLParser, django.utils.html.strip_tags() would be extremely slow to evaluate certain inputs containing large sequences of nested incomplete HTML entities. The strip_tags() method is used to implement the corresponding striptags template filter, which was thus also vulnerable. strip_tags() now avoids recursive calls to HTMLParser when progress removing tags, but necessarily incomplete HTML entities, stops being made",
