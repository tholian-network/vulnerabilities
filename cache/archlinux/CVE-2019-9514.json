	"type": "denial of service",
	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "An issue has been found in several HTTP/2 implementations, where the attacker opens a number of streams and sends an invalid request over each stream that should solicit a stream of RST_STREAM frames from the peer. Depending on how the peer queues the RST_STREAM frames, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service.",
