  "name": "CVE-2021-37621",
  "type": "denial of service",
  "severity": "Low",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "An infinite loop was found in Exiv2 versions 0.27.4 and earlier. The infinite loop is triggered when Exiv2 is used to print the metadata of a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file.\n\nNote that this bug is only triggered when printing the image ICC profile, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation that requires an extra command line option (`-p C`).",
