  "type": "incorrect calculation",
  "severity": "Low",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "ntpd Bug 2085 described a condition where the root delay was included twice, causing the jitter value to be higher than expected. Due to a misinterpretation of a small-print variable in The Book, the fix for this problem was incorrect, resulting in a root distance that did not include the peer dispersion. The calculations and formula have been reviewed and reconciled, and the code has been updated accordingly.",
