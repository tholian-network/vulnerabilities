	"description": "A denial of service has been found in Dovecot before 2.3.9.3, where lib-smtp doesn't handle truncated command parameters properly, resulting in infinite loop taking 100% CPU for the process. This happens for LMTP (where it doesn't matter so much) and also for submission-login where unauthenticated users can trigger it.",
