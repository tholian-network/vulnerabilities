	"type": "incorrect calculation",
	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "In TensorFlow before version 2.6.0 the implementation of tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Grad is vulnerable to an integer overflow issue caused by converting a signed integer value to an unsigned one and then allocating memory based on this value. The implementation uses the axis value as the size argument to absl::InlinedVector constructor. But, the constructor uses an unsigned type for the argument, so the implicit conversion transforms the negative value to a large integer.",
