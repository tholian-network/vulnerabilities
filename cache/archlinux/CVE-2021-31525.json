  "type": "denial of service",

  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "A security issue has been found in Go before version 1.16.4. ReadRequest and ReadResponse in net/http can hit an unrecoverable panic when reading a very large header (over 7MB on 64-bit architectures, or over 4MB on 32-bit ones). Transport and Client are vulnerable and the program can be made to crash by a malicious server.  Server is not vulnerable by default, but can be if the default max header of 1MB is overridden by setting Server.MaxHeaderBytes to a higher value, in which case the program can be made to crash by a malicious client.",
