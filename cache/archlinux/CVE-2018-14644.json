  "name": "CVE-2018-14644",
  "type": "denial of service",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor before 4.1.5 where a remote attacker sending a DNS query for a meta-type like OPT can lead to a zone being wrongly cached as failing DNSSEC validation. It only arises if the parent zone is signed, and all the authoritative servers for that parent zone answer with FORMERR to a query for at least one of the meta-types. As a result, subsequent queries from clients requesting DNSSEC validation will be answered with a ServFail.",
