	"description": "GetEfiGlobalVariable2() is used in some instances when looking up the SecureBoot UEFI variable. The API can fail in certain circumstances, for example, if AllocatePool() fails or if gRT->GetVariable() fails. In the case of secure boot checks, it is critical that this return value is checked. if an attacker can cause the API to fail, it would currently constitute a secure boot bypass. This return value check is missing from DxeImageVerificationHandler.",
