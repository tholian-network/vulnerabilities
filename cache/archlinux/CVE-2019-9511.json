  "name": "CVE-2019-9511",
  "type": "denial of service",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "An issue has been found in several HTTP/2 implementations, where the attacker requests a large amount of data from a specified resource over multiple streams. They manipulate window size and stream priority to force the server to queue the data in 1-byte chunks. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service.",
