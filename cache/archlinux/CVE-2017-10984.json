  "name": "CVE-2017-10984",
  "type": "arbitrary code execution",
  "severity": "Critical",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "A security issue has been found in freeradius <= 3.0.15, where the data2vp_wimax() function checks for WiMAX attributes which are too small, but it does not check for WiMAX attributes which are too large. As a result, the server can be convinced to read past the end of an attribute, and to write past the end of memory allocated via malloc(). A remote attacker with the ability to send packets which are accepted by the server can cause a write overflow, possibly leading to remote code execution.",
