  "description": "Multiple exploitable integer truncation vulnerabilities exist within the MPEG-4 decoding functionality of the GPAC Project on Advanced Content library v1.0.1. A specially crafted MPEG-4 input can cause an improper memory allocation resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow that causes memory corruption. The implementation of the parser used for the \u201cXtra\u201d FOURCC code is handled. An attacker can convince a user to open a video to trigger this vulnerability.",
