  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Local",
  "description": "Exim 4 before 4.94.2 allows execution with unnecessary privileges. Because Exim operates as root in the spool directory (owned by a non-root user), an attacker can write to a /var/spool/exim4/input spool header file, in which a crafted recipient address can indirectly lead to command execution.",
