  "description": "The patch applied to address CVE-2016-6307 resulted in an issue where if a message larger than approx 16k is received then the underlying buffer to store the incoming message is reallocated and moved. Unfortunately a dangling pointer to the old location is left which results in an attempt to write to the previously freed location. This is likely to result in a crash, however it could potentially lead to execution of arbitrary code.\nThis issue was reported to OpenSSL on 23rd September 2016 by Robert \u015awi\u0119cki (Google Security Team), and was found using honggfuzz.",
