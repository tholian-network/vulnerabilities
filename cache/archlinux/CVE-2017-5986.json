	"type": "denial of service",
	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "It was reported that with Linux kernel, earlier than version v4.10-rc8, an application may trigger a BUG_ON in sctp_wait_for_sndbuf if the socket tx buffer is full, a thread is waiting on it to queue more data, and meanwhile another thread peels off the association being used by the first thread. This issue may then lead to a segmentation fault resulting in denial of service.",
