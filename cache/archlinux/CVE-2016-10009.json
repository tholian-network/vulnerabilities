  "name": "CVE-2016-10009",
  "type": "arbitrary code execution",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Local",
  "description": "It was found that ssh-agent could load PKCS#11 modules from paths outside of a trusted whitelist. An attacker able to load a crafted PKCS#11 module across a forwarded agent channel could potentially use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the system running the ssh-agent. Note that the attacker must have control of the forwarded agent-socket and the ability to write to the filesystem of the host running ssh-agent.",
