  "type": "privilege escalation",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Local",
  "description": "A security issue has been found in procps-ng <= 3.3.14. An attacker can exploit an integer overflow in libprocps's file2strvec() function and carry out an LPE when another user, administrator, or script executes a vulnerable utility (pgrep, pidof, pkill, and w are vulnerable by default; other utilities are vulnerable if executed with non-default options). Moreover, an attacker's process running inside a container can trigger this vulnerability in a utility running outside the container: the attacker can exploit this userland vulnerability and break out of the container or chroot.",
