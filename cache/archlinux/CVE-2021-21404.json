  "description": "In Syncthing before version 1.15.0, the relay server `syncthing-relaysrv` can be caused to crash and exit by sending a relay message with a negative length field. Similarly, Syncthing itself can crash for the same reason if given a malformed message from a malicious relay server when attempting to join the relay. Relay joins are essentially random (from a subset of low latency relays) and Syncthing will by default restart when crashing, at which point it's likely to pick another non-malicious relay. This flaw is fixed in version 1.15.0.",

  "notes": "Workaround\r\n==========\r\n\r\nSyncthing can be configured to not use relays, or to only use specific, trusted relays. If Syncthing is used in a closed environment or with relaying disabled, i.e., it does not communicate with unknown relays, Syncthing is not vulnerable. There is no known workaround for syncthing-relaysrv."
