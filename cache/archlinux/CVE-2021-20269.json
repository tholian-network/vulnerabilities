  "type": "information disclosure",
  "severity": "Low",
  "vector": "Local",
  "description": "A security issue was found in kexec-tools where vmcore-dmesg.txt extracted from the vmcore of a previous kernel panic is created world-readable. It is possible that this could be used to leak kernel internal information from a previous execution if it was output to the ring buffer or part of the panic backtrace. An unprivileged user with a local account can use this to extract kernel internal information resulting in an information leak.",
