  "name": "CVE-2020-25669",
  "type": "information disclosure",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Local",
  "description": "A use-after-free read in the Linux kernel before 5.9.10 could be used by local attackers to read privileged information or potentially crash the kernel. The function sunkbd_reinit was scheduled by sunkbd_interrupt before the struct sunkbd was freed. Though the dangling pointer is set to NULL in sunkbd_disconnect, there is still an alias in sunkbd_reinit causing use-after-free.",
