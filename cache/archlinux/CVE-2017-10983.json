	"type": "denial of service",
	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "A security issue has been found in freeradius <= 3.0.15, where the fr_dhcp_decode() function performed a strcmp() on binary data in an internal data structure, instead of checking the length of the option and doing a memcmp. A remote attacker with the ability to send packets which are accepted by the server can make the server read its memory until it reaches a zero byte or crashes, causing a denial of service.",
