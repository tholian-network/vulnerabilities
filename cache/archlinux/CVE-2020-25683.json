  "name": "CVE-2020-25683",
  "type": "denial of service",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "A heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in dnsmasq before version 2.83 when DNSSEC is enabled and before it validates the received DNS entries. A remote attacker, who can create valid DNS replies, could use this flaw to cause an overflow in a heap-allocated memory. This flaw is caused by the lack of length checks in rtc1035.c:extract_name(), which could be abused to make the code execute memcpy() with a negative size in get_rdata() and cause a crash in dnsmasq, resulting in a Denial of Service.",
