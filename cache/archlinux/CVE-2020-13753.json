{
  "name": "CVE-2020-13753",
  "type": "sandbox escape",
  "severity": "High",
  "vector": "Local",
  "description": "The bubblewrap sandbox of WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit, prior to 2.28.3, failed to properly block access to CLONE_NEWUSER and the TIOCSTI ioctl. CLONE_NEWUSER could potentially be used to confuse xdg- desktop-portal, which allows access outside the sandbox. TIOCSTI can be used to directly execute commands outside the sandbox by writing to the controlling terminal\u2019s input buffer, similar to CVE-2017-5226.",
