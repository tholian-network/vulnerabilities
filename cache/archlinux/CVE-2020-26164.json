	"notes": "Workaround\r\n==========\r\n\r\nWe advise you to stop KDE Connect when on untrusted networks like those on airports or conferences.\r\n\r\nSince kdeconnect is dbus activated it is relatively hard to make sure it stays stopped so the brute\r\nforce approach is to uninstall the kdeconnect package from your system and then run\r\n    kquitapp5 kdeconnectd\r\nJust install the package again once you're back in a trusted network."
