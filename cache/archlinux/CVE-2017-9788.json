  "name": "CVE-2017-9788",
  "type": "information disclosure",
  "severity": "High",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "A security issue has been found in apache's mod_auth_digest <= 2.4.26, leading to information disclosure or denial of service. The value placeholder in [Proxy-]Authorization headers of type 'Digest' was not initialized or reset before or between successive key=value assignments by mod_auth_digest. Providing an initial key with no '=' assignment could reflect the stale value of uninitialized pool memory used by the prior request, leading to leakage of potentially confidential information, and a segfault.",
