	"type": "denial of service",
	"severity": "High",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "A NULL pointer dereference has been found in OpenSSL versions 1.1.1d, 1.1.1e and 1.1.1f. Server or client applications that call the SSL_check_chain() function during or after a TLS 1.3 handshake may crash due to a NULL pointer dereference as a result of incorrect handling of the \"signature_algorithms_cert\" TLS extension. The crash occurs if an invalid or unrecognised signature algorithm is received from the peer. This could be exploited by a malicious peer in a Denial of Service attack.",
