  "type": "access restriction bypass",
  "severity": "High",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "A security issue has been found in Apache Tomcat < 7.0.18 and < 8.0.44. The error page mechanism of the Java Servlet Specification requires that, when an error occurs and an error page is configured for the error that occurred, the original request and response are forwarded to the error page. This means that the request is presented to the error page with the original HTTP method. If the error page is a static file, expected behaviour is to serve the content of the file as if processing a GET request, regardless of the actual HTTP method. Tomcat's Default Servlet did not do this. Depending on the original request this could lead to unexpected and undesirable results for static error pages including, if the DefaultServlet is configured to permit writes, the replacement or removal of the custom error page.",
