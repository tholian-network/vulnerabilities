  "description": "On the Linux kernel 3.6 and later before version 5.15.5, it is possible for an attacker to leak or change data that resides on hugetlbfs. Such data can reside on hugetlbfs, for instance if the victim runs mmap() using the MAP_HUGETLB or shmget() with SHM_HUGETLB. If a victim maps executable code onto hugetlbfs, the executable can be modified as well.",
