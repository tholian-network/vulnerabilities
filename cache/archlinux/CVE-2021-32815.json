  "name": "CVE-2021-32815",
  "type": "denial of service",
  "severity": "Low",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "An assertion failure was found in Exiv2 versions 0.27.4 and earlier. The assertion failure is triggered when Exiv2 is used to modify the metadata of a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file.\n\nNote that this bug is only triggered when modifying the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as `fi`.",
