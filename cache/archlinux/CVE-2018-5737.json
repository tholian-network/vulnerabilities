	"notes": "Workaround:\r\n\r\nSetting \"max-stale-ttl 0;\" in named.conf will prevent exploitation of this vulnerability (but will effectively disable the serve-stale feature.)\r\n\r\nSetting \"stale-answer enable off;\" is not sufficient to prevent exploitation, max-stale-ttl needs to be set to zero."
