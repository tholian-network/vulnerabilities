  "name": "CVE-2019-0197",
  "type": "denial of service",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "An issue has been found in Apache HTTPd >= 2.4.34 and <= 2.4.38. When HTTP/2 was enabled for a http: host or H2Upgrade was enabled for h2 on a https: host, an Upgrade request from http/1.1 to http/2 that was not the first request on a connection could lead to a misconfiguration and crash. A server that never enabled the h2 protocol or that only enabled it for https: and did not configure the \"H2Upgrade on\" is unaffected by this.",
