  "description": "In TensorFlow before version 2.6.1, if tf.tile is called with a large input argument then the TensorFlow process will crash due to a CHECK-failure caused by an overflow. The number of elements in the output tensor is too much for the int64_t type and the overflow is detected via a CHECK statement. This aborts the process.",
