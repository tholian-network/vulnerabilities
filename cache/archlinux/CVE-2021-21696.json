  "severity": "High",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "Jenkins before version 2.319 does not limit agent read/write access to the libs/ directory inside build directories when using the FilePath APIs. This directory is used by the \"Pipeline: Shared Groovy Libraries\" Plugin to store copies of shared libraries.\r\n\r\nThis allows attackers in control of agent processes to replace the code of a trusted library with a modified variant, resulting in unsandboxed code execution in the Jenkins controller process.\r\n\r\nJenkins 2.319 prohibits agent read/write access to the libs/ directory inside build directories.",
