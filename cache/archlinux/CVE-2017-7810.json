  "description": "Mozilla developers and community members Christoph Diehl, Jan de Mooij, Jason Kratzer, Randell Jesup, Tom Ritter, Tyson Smith, and Sebastian Hengst reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox <= 55, Firefox ESR <= 52.3, and Thunderbird <= 52.3. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.",
