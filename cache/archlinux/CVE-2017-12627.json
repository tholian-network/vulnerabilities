  "description": "The Xerces-C XML parser mishandles certain kinds of external DTD references, resulting in dereference of a NULL pointer while processing the path to the DTD. The bug allows for a denial of service attack in applications that allow DTD processing and do not prevent external DTD usage, and could conceivably result in remote code execution.",
