	"severity": "Low",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "In pygments 1.1+, fixed in 2.7.4, the lexers used to parse programming languages rely heavily on regular expressions. Some of the regular expressions have exponential or cubic worst-case complexity and are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS). By crafting malicious input, an attacker can cause a denial of service.",
