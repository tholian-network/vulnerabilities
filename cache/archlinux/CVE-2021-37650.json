  "description": "In TensorFlow before version 2.6.0 the implementation for tf.raw_ops.ExperimentalDatasetToTFRecord and tf.raw_ops.DatasetToTFRecord can trigger heap buffer overflow and segmentation fault. The implementation assumes that all records in the dataset are of string type. However, there is no check for that, and the example given above uses numeric types.",
