  "name": "CVE-2020-25686",
  "type": "insufficient validation",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "A flaw was found when receiving a query, where dnsmasq before version 2.83 does not check for an existing pending request for the same name and forwards a new request. By default, a maximum of 150 pending queries can be sent to upstream servers, so there can be at most 150 queries for the same name. This flaw allows an off-path attacker on the network to substantially reduce the number of attempts that would have to be performed to forge a reply and have it accepted by dnsmasq. This issue is mentioned in the \"Birthday Attacks\" section of RFC5452. If chained with CVE-2020-25684, the attack complexity of a successful attack is reduced.",
