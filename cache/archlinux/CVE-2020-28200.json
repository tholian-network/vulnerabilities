  "description": "A security issue has been found in Pigeonhole before version 0.5.15. The Sieve interpreter is not protected against abusive scripts that claim excessive resource usage, especially scripts using massive amounts of regexps. This means an attacker can cause a denial of service of the mail delivery system by using excessive amount of CPU and/or reaching the lmtp/lda process limits.",
