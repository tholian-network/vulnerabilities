  "name": "CVE-2020-25829",
  "type": "denial of service",
  "severity": "High",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor before 4.3.5 where a remote attacker can cause the cached records for a given name to be updated to the \u2018Bogus\u2019 DNSSEC validation state, instead of their actual DNSSEC \u2018Secure\u2019 state, via a DNS ANY query. This results in a denial of service for installations that always validate (dnssec=validate) and for clients requesting validation when on-demand validation is enabled (dnssec=process).",
