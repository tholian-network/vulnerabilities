	"description": "In TensorFlow before version 2.6.0, when restoring tensors via raw APIs, if the tensor name is not provided, TensorFlow can be tricked into dereferencing a null pointer. Alternatively, attackers can read memory outside the bounds of heap allocated data by providing some tensor names but not enough for a successful restoration. The implementation retrieves the tensor list corresponding to the tensor_name user controlled input and immediately retrieves the tensor at the restoration index (controlled via preferred_shard argument). This occurs without validating that the provided list has enough values. If the list is empty this results in dereferencing a null pointer (undefined behavior). If, however, the list has some elements, if the restoration index is outside the bounds this results in heap OOB read.",
