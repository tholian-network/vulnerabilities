	"type": "denial of service",
	"severity": "Low",
	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "A security issue has been found in TensorFlow before version 2.4.2. The `tf.raw_ops.Conv3DBackprop*` operations fail to validate that the input tensors are not empty. In turn, this would result in a division by 0. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a91bb59769f19146d5a0c20060244378e878f140/tensorflow/core/kernels/conv_grad_ops_3d.cc#L430-L450) does not check that the divisor used in computing the shard size is not zero. Thus, if attacker controls the input sizes, they can trigger a denial of service via a division by zero error.",
