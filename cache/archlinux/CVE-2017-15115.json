  "name": "CVE-2017-15115",
  "type": "privilege escalation",
  "severity": "High",
  "vector": "Local",
  "description": "It was found that in Linux kernel before 4.14 when peeling off an association to the socket in another network namespace, all transports in this association are not to be rehashed and keep use the old key in hashtable. A kernel would miss removing transports from hashtable when closing the socket and all transports are being freed. Later on a use-after-free issue could be caused when looking up an association and dereferencing the transports.",
