  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "A denial of service have been found in Dovecot before 2.3.9.3, where a specially crafted e-mail can cause a mailbox to have permanently inaccessible mail, or the e-mail itself can be stuck in delivery. This happens because the snippet generation crashes if a message is large enough that message-parser returns multiple body blocks, the first block(s) don't contain the full snippet (e.g. full of whitespace) and the input ends with '>'.",
