  "severity": "High",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "A PGP signature verification bypass has been found in fwupd prior to 1.4.0, and in libjcat <= 0.1.2. The issue is that if a detached signature is actually a PGP message, gpgme_op_verify() returns the rather perplexing GPG_ERR_NO_ERROR, and then gpgme_op_verify_result() builds an empty list.",
