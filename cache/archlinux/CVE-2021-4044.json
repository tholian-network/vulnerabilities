  "type": "denial of service",
  "severity": "Medium",

  "description": "A security issue has been found in OpenSSL 3.0.0. Internally libssl in OpenSSL calls X509_verify_cert() on the client side to verify a certificate supplied by a server. That function may return a negative return value to indicate an internal error (for example out of memory). Such a negative return value is mishandled by OpenSSL and will cause an IO function (such as SSL_connect() or SSL_do_handshake()) to not indicate success and a subsequent call to SSL_get_error() to return the value SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY. This return value is only supposed to be returned by OpenSSL if the application has previously called SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback(). Since most applications do not do this the SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY return value from SSL_get_error() will be totally unexpected and applications may not behave correctly as a result. The exact behaviour will depend on the application but it could result in crashes, infinite loops or other similar incorrect responses.\r\n\r\nThis issue is made more serious in combination with a separate bug in OpenSSL 3.0 that will cause X509_verify_cert() to indicate an internal error when processing a certificate chain. This will occur where a certificate does not include the Subject Alternative Name extension but where a Certificate Authority has enforced name constraints. This issue can occur even with valid chains.\r\n\r\nBy combining the two issues an attacker could induce incorrect, application dependent behaviour.\r\n\r\nOpenSSL 3.0.0 SSL/TLS clients are affected by this issue. Users of this version should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.0.1. OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are not affected by this issue.",
