  "description": "Giuseppe Scrivano discovered that overlayfs did not properly perform permission checking when copying up files in an overlayfs, and can be exploited from within a user namespace, if, for example, unprivileged user namespaces are allowed.\r\nAn attacker can abuse this to get read access to files on the system that they would not normally be permitted to access.",
