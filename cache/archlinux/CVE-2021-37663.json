  "vector": "Local",
  "description": "In TensorFlow before version 2.6.0 due to incomplete validation in tf.raw_ops.QuantizeV2, an attacker can trigger undefined behavior via binding a reference to a null pointer or can access data outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays. The implementation has some validation but does not check that min_range and max_range both have the same non-zero number of elements. If axis is provided (i.e., not -1), then validation should check that it is a value in range for the rank of input tensor and then the lengths of min_range and max_range inputs match the axis dimension of the input tensor.",
