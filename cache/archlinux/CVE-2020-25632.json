  "name": "CVE-2020-25632",
  "type": "arbitrary code execution",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Local",
  "description": "The rmmod implementation for grub2 is flawed, allowing an attacker to unload a module used as a dependency without checking if any other dependent module is still loaded. This leads to a use-after-free scenario possibly allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code and by-pass Secure Boot protections.",
