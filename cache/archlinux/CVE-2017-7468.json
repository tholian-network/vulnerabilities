  "name": "CVE-2017-7468",
  "type": "certificate verification bypass",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "libcurl from 7.52.0 to and including 7.53.1 would attempt to resume a TLS session even if the client certificate had changed. That is unacceptable since a server by specification is allowed to skip the client certificate check on resume, and may instead use the old identity which was established by the previous certificate (or no certificate).\r\nThis flaw is a regression and identical to CVE-2016-5419 reported on August 3rd 2016, but affecting a different version range.",
