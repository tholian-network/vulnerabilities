  "vector": "Local",
  "description": "A specially crafted binary can make Rizin segfault when it tries to analyze it (doing a full analysis with aaa). In rz_core_analysis_type_match retctx structure was initialized on the stack only after a \"goto out_function\", where a field of that structure was freed. When the goto path is taken, the field is not properly initialized and it could cause a crash of Rizin or have other effects.",
