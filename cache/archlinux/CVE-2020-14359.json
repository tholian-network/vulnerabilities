  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "A vulnerability was found in keycloak, where on using lower case HTTP headers (via cURL) a Gatekeeper can be bypassed. Lower case headers are also accepted by some webservers (e.g. Jetty). This means there is no protection when putting a Gatekeeper in front of a Jetty server and using lowercase headers.",
