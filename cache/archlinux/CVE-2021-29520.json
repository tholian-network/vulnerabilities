  "description": "A security issue has been found in TensorFlow before version 2.4.2. Missing validation between arguments to `tf.raw_ops.Conv3DBackprop*` operations can result in heap buffer overflows. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/4814fafb0ca6b5ab58a09411523b2193fed23fed/tensorflow/core/kernels/conv_grad_shape_utils.cc#L94-L153) assumes that the `input`, `filter_sizes` and `out_backprop` tensors have the same shape, as they are accessed in parallel.",
