	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "embed/ephy-web-view.c in GNOME Web (aka Epiphany) through 3.31.4 allows address bar spoofing because a page load triggered by JavaScript leads to updating an address as if it were triggered by a safer visit type (e.g., VISIT_LINK, VISIT_TYPED, VISIT_BOOKMARK, or VISIT_HOMEPAGE). This is similar to the CVE-2018-8383 issue in Microsoft Edge.",
