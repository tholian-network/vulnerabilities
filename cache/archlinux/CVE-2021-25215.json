  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "DNAME records, described in RFC 6672, provide a way to redirect a subtree of the domain name tree in the DNS. A flaw in the way \"named\" processes these records may trigger an attempt to add the same RRset to the ANSWER section more than once.\r\nIn BIND before version 9.16.14, when a vulnerable version of \"named\" receives a query for a record triggering the flaw described above, the \"named\" process will terminate due to a failed assertion check.",
