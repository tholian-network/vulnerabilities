  "description": "Apache Maven may follow repositories that are defined in a dependency\u2019s Project Object Model (pom) which may be surprising to some users, resulting in potential risk if a malicious actor takes over that repository or is able to insert themselves into a position to pretend to be that repository. Maven is changing the default behavior to no longer follow http (non-SSL) repository references by default in version 3.8.1.\r\n\r\nIf you are currently using a repository manager to govern the repositories used by your builds, you are unaffected by the risks present in the legacy behavior, and are unaffected by this vulnerability and change to default behavior.",
