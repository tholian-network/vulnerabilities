  ],
  "notes": "Looks like the issue was introduced by 89c22d8, but was prevented in mainline because since 3.19 skb_copy_and_csum_datagram_iovec() is not used in this path anymore, and skb_copy_and_csum_datagram_msg() prevents the problem. However it looks like 89c22d8 was backported to older \"stable\" kernels without the move to skb_copy_and_csum_datagram_msg() , making them vulnerables."
