	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "A security issue has been found in crypto++ before 6.0.0 where the Zinflate class, used by classes like Gunzip and Inflator, could perform an out-of-bounds read when decompressing data. The out-of-bounds read occurs on a static table of 30 elements, allocated in initialized memory. An attacker can craft a ZIP file that allows a read of the last two non-existent elements.",
