	"type": "directory traversal",
	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "It has been discovered that maliciously crafted minion IDs can cause unwanted directory traversals on the salt-master. The flaw is within the minion id validation which could allow certain minions to authenticate to a master despite not having the correct credentials. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must create a salt-minion with an ID containing path seperators that will cause a directory traversal.",
