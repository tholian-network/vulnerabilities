  "name": "CVE-2021-21430",
  "type": "information disclosure",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Local",
  "description": "A security issue has been found in openapi-generator before version 5.1.1. On Unix-Like systems, the system temporary directory is shared between all local users. When files/directories are created, the default umask settings for the process are respected. As a result, by default, most processes/apis will create files/directories with the permissions -rw-r--r-- and drwxr-xr-x respectively, unless an API that explicitly sets safe file permissions is used.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists due to the use of the JDK method File.createTempFile. This method creates an insecure temporary files that can leave application and system data vulnerable to exposure.\r\n\r\nAuto-generated code (Java, Scala) that deals with uploading or downloading binary data through API endpoints will create insecure temporary files during the process. For example, if the API endpoint returns a PDF file, the auto-generated clients will first download the PDF into a insecure temporary file that can be read by anyone on the system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability impacts generated code. If this code was generated as a one-off occasion, not as a part of an automated CI/CD process, this code will remain vulnerable until fixed manually!",
