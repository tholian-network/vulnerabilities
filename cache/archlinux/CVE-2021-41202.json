	"type": "incorrect calculation",
	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "In TensorFlow before version 2.6.1, while calculating the size of the output within the tf.range kernel, there is a conditional statement of type int64 = condition ? int64 : double. Due to C++ implicit conversion rules, both branches of the condition will be cast to double and the result would be truncated before the assignment. This result in overflows.",
