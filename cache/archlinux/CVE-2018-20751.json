  "description": "An issue was discovered in crop_page in PoDoFo 0.9.6. For a crafted PDF document, pPage->GetObject()->GetDictionary().AddKey(PdfName(\"MediaBox\"),var) can be problematic due to the function GetObject() being called for the pPage NULL pointer object. The value of pPage at this point is 0x0, which causes a NULL pointer dereference. The issue is fixed in PoDoFo version 0.9.7.",
