	"description": "Through a malicious URL that contained a quote character it was possible to inject HTML code in KMail's plain text viewer. Due to the parser used on the URL it was not possible to include the equal sign (=) or a space into the injected HTML, which greatly reduces the available HTML functionality. Although it is possible to include an HTML comment indicator to hide content.",
