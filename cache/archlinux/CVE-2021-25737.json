  "name": "CVE-2021-25737",
  "type": "insufficient validation",
  "severity": "Low",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "A security issue was discovered in kube-apiserver before version 1.21.1 where a user may be able to redirect pod traffic to private networks on a node. Kubernetes already prevents creation of Endpoint IPs in the localhost or link-local range, but the same validation was not performed on EndpointSlice IPs.",

  ],
  "notes": "Workaround\r\n==========\r\n\r\nTo mitigate this vulnerability without upgrading kube-apiserver, you can create a validating admission webhook that prevents EndpointSlices with endpoint addresses in the 127.0.0.0/8 and 169.254.0.0/16 ranges. If you have an existing admission policy mechanism (like OPA Gatekeeper) you can create a policy that enforces this restriction."
