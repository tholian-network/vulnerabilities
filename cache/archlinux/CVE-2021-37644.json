  "description": "In TensorFlow before version 2.6.0 providing a negative element to num_elements list argument of tf.raw_ops.TensorListReserve causes the runtime to abort the process due to reallocating a std::vector to have a negative number of elements. The implementation calls std::vector.resize() with the new size controlled by input given by the user, without checking that this input is valid.",
