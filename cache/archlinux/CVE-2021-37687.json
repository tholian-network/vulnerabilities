  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Local",
  "description": "In TensorFlow before version 2.6.0 TFLite's GatherNd implementation does not support negative indices but there are no checks for this situation. Hence, an attacker can read arbitrary data from the heap by carefully crafting a model with negative values in indices. Similar issue exists in Gather implementation.",
