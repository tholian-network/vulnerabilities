  "type": "directory traversal",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "It has been discovered that maliciously crafted minion IDs can cause unwanted directory traversals on the salt-master. The flaw is within the minion id validation which could allow certain minions to authenticate to a master despite not having the correct credentials. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must create a salt-minion with an ID containing characters that will cause a directory traversal.",
