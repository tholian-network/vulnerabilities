  "name": "CVE-2021-37689",
  "type": "denial of service",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Local",
  "description": "In TensorFlow before version 2.6.0 an attacker can craft a TFLite model that would trigger a null pointer dereference, which would result in a crash and denial of service. This is caused by the MLIR optimization of L2NormalizeReduceAxis operator. The implementation unconditionally dereferences a pointer to an iterator to a vector without checking that the vector has elements.",
