  "vector": "Local",
  "description": "A vulnerability was found in libdwarf in dwarf_elf_access.c:1071. A crafted ELF file may lead to a large offset value, which bigger than the size of target_section heap chunk, then this WRITE_UNALIGNED() function will write the value of &outval out of the heap chunk. The offset is a 64bit unsigned int value, so this is more than a heap overflow bug, but also a out-of-bound write bug.",
