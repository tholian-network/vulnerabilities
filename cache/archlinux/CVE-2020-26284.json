	"type": "arbitrary command execution",
	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "A security issue was found in Hugo on the Windows platform before version 0.79.1. Hugo depends on Go's os/exec for certain features, e.g. for rendering of Pandoc documents if these binaries are found in the system %PATH% on Windows. However, if a malicious file with the same name (exe or bat) is found in the current working directory at the time of running hugo, the malicious command will be invoked instead of the system one.",
