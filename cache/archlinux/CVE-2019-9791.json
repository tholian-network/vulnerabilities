	"type": "arbitrary code execution",
	"severity": "Critical",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "The type inference system in Firefox before 66.0 allows the compilation of functions that can cause type confusions between arbitrary objects when compiled through the IonMonkey just-in-time (JIT) compiler and when the constructor function is entered through on-stack replacement (OSR). This allows for possible arbitrary reading and writing of objects during an exploitable crash.",
