	"description": "An use after free vulnerability has been discovered in Apache HTTP 2.4.27 that causes a corrupted Allow header to be constructed in response to HTTP OPTIONS requests. This can leak pieces of arbitrary memory from the server process that may contain secrets. The memory pieces change after multiple requests, so for a vulnerable host an arbitrary number of memory chunks can be leaked.\r\nThe bug appears if a webmaster tries to use the \"Limit\" directive with an invalid HTTP method.",
