  "name": "CVE-2019-12749",
  "type": "access restriction bypass",
  "severity": "High",
  "vector": "Local",
  "description": "It has been discovered that dbus before 1.12.16 allows cookie spoofing because of symlink mishandling in the reference implementation of DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 in the libdbus library. This issue only affects the DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 authentication mechanism.\r\nA malicious client with write access to its own home directory could manipulate a ~/.dbus-keyrings symlink to cause a DBusServer with a different uid to read and write in unintended locations. In the worst case, this could result in the DBusServer reusing a cookie that is known to the malicious client, and treating that cookie as evidence that a subsequent client connection came from an attacker-chosen uid, allowing authentication bypass.",
