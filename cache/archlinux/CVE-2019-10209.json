	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "An issue has been found in PostgreSQL >= 11.0 and < 11.5. In a database containing hypothetical, user-defined hash equality operators, an attacker could read arbitrary bytes of server memory. For an attack to become possible, a superuser would need to create unusual operators. It is possible for operators not purpose-crafted for attack to have the properties that enable an attack, but we are not aware of specific examples.",
