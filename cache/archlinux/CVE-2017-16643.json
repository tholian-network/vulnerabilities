  "name": "CVE-2017-16643",
  "type": "denial of service",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Local",
  "description": "The parse_hid_report_descriptor function in drivers/input/tablet/gtco.c in the Linux kernel before 4.13.11 allows local users to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted USB device. The issue occurs because parse_hid_report_descriptor() has a while (i < length) loop, which only guarantees that there's at least 1 byte in the buffer, but the loop body can read multiple bytes which causes out-of-bounds access.",
