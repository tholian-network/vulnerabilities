  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "A security issue has been discovered in Ruby before versions 3.0.2, 2.7.4 and 2.6.8. A malicious FTP server can use the PASV response to trick Net::FTP into connecting back to a given IP address and port. This potentially makes Net::FTP extract information about services that are otherwise private and not disclosed (e.g., the attacker can conduct port scans and service banner extractions).",
