  "name": "CVE-2018-0495",
  "type": "private key recovery",
  "severity": "High",
  "vector": "Local",
  "description": "An implementation flaw has been discovered in multiple cryptographic libraries that allows a side-channel based attacker to recover ECDSA or DSA private keys. When these cryptographic libraries use the private key to create a signature, such as for a TLS or SSH connection, they inadvertently leak information through memory caches. An unprivileged attacker running on the same machine can collect the information from a few thousand signatures and recover the value of the private key.",
