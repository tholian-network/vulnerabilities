	"description": "An information disclosure issue has been found in Django before 3.0.7, via malformed memcached keys. In cases where a memcached backend does not perform key validation, passing malformed cache keys could result in a key collision, and potential data leakage. In order to avoid this vulnerability, key validation is added to the memcached cache backends.",
