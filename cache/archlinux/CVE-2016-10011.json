  "name": "CVE-2016-10011",

  "vector": "Local",
  "description": "It was found that there is a theoretical leak of host private key material to privilege-separated child processes via realloc() when reading keys. No such leak was observed in practice for normal-sized keys, nor does a leak to the child processes directly expose key material to unprivileged users.",
