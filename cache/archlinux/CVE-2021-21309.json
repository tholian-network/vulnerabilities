  "name": "CVE-2021-21309",
  "type": "arbitrary code execution",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "Redis 4.0 or newer uses a configurable limit for the maximum supported bulk input size. By default it is 512MB, which is a safe value for all platforms. On 32-bit systems, setting the proto-max-bulk-len config parameter to a high value may result in an integer overflow and a subsequent heap overflow when receiving a large request from a client. The issue is fixed in Redis version 6.2.0, 6.0.11 and 5.0.11.",
