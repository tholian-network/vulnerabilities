  "description": "matrix-synapse before 0.34.1 is vulnerable to private key recovery as synapse will attempt to derive a secret key from other secrets specified in the configuration file for \"macaroon_secret_key\". However, in all versions of Synapse up to and including 0.34.0, this process was faulty and a predictable value was used instead.",
