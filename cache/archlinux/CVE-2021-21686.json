	"description": "A security issue has been found in Jenkins before version 2.319. File path filters do not canonicalize paths, allowing operations to follow symbolic links to outside allowed directories. This allows agent processes to read and write arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system, and obtain some information about Jenkins controller file systems.",
