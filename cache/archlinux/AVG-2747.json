  "notes": "By default, for linux-hardened, an unprivileged user can't trigger an attack. To prevent the possibility of an unprivileged users' attack, set kernel.perf_event_paranoid to the value 3.\r\nTo confirm the current state, inspect the sysctl with the command:\r\n\r\n    cat /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid\r\n\r\nThe setting >=3 would mean that unprivileged users can not use performance events, mitigating the flaw."
