  "type": "information disclosure",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "A security issue was found in the Prosody.im XMPP server software before version 0.11.9. It was discovered that Prosody does not use a constant-time algorithm for comparing certain secret strings when running under Lua 5.2 or later. This can potentially be used in a timing attack to reveal the contents of secret strings to an attacker.",
