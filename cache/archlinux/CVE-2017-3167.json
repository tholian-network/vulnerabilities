  "type": "authentication bypass",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "An authentication bypass flaw has been found in Apache httpd < 2.4.26, where the use of the ap_get_basic_auth_pw() function by third-party modules outside of the authentication phase may lead to authentication requirements being bypassed. Third-party module writers SHOULD use ap_get_basic_auth_components(), available in 2.2.33 and 2.4.26, instead of ap_get_basic_auth_pw(). Modules which call the legacy ap_get_basic_auth_pw() during the authentication phase MUST either immediately authenticate the user after the call, or else stop the request immediately with an error response, to avoid incorrectly authenticating the current request.",
