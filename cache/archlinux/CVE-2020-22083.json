  "description": "** DISPUTED ** jsonpickle allows arbitrary code execution during deserialisation of a malicious payload through the decode() function. Note: It has been argued that this is expected and clearly documented behaviour. pickle is known to be capable of causing arbitrary code execution, and must not be used with untrusted data.",
