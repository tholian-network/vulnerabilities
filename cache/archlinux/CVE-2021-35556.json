  "type": "denial of service",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "A security issue has been found in OpenJDK before versions 7u321, 8u312, 11.0.13 and 17.0.1 in the client-libs/javax.swing component. An easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise OpenJDK. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of OpenJDK.\r\n\r\nNote : This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator).",
