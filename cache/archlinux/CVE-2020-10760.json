	"description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in all samba LDAP server versions before 4.10.17, before 4.11.11, before 4.12.4 used in a AC DC configuration. A Samba LDAP user could use this flaw to crash samba.",

	"notes": "By default, Samba 4.10 is run using the \"standard\" process model which is one-process-per-client.  (Later versions use 'prefork').\r\nThis is controlled by the -M or --model parameter to the samba binary.\r\nAll Samba versions are impacted if -M prefork or -M single is used. To mitigate this issue, select -M standard (however this will use more memory, and may cause resource exhaustion)."
