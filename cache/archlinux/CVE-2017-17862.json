  "name": "CVE-2017-17862",
  "type": "denial of service",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Local",
  "description": "It has been discovered that kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel before 4.14.9 and 4.9.72 ignore unreachable code, even though it would still be processed by JIT compilers. This behavior, also considered an improper branch-pruning logic issue, could possibly be used by local users for denial of service.",
