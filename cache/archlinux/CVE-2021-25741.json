  "severity": "High",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "A security issue was discovered in kubelet before version 1.22.2 where a user may be able to create a container with subpath volume mounts to access files & directories outside of the volume, including on the host filesystem.",

  ],
  "notes": "Workaround\r\n==========\r\n\r\nTo mitigate this vulnerability without upgrading kubelet, you can disable the VolumeSubpath feature gate on kubelet and kube-apiserver, and remove any existing Pods making use of the feature.\r\n\r\nYou can also use admission control to prevent less-trusted users from running containers as root to reduce the impact of successful exploitation."
