	"type": "arbitrary code execution",
	"severity": "Low",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "An overflow can occur in MDC2_Update() either if called directly or through the EVP_DigestUpdate() function using MDC2. If an attacker is able to supply very large amounts of input data after a previous call to EVP_EncryptUpdate() with a partial block then a length check can overflow resulting in a heap corruption.\nThe amount of data needed is comparable to SIZE_MAX which is impractical on most platforms.",
