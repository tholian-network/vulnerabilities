  "description": "A cross-site scripting vulnerability was discovered in python-lxml's clean module before version 4.6.2. The module's parser didn't properly imitate browsers, which caused different behaviors between the sanitizer and the user's page. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to run arbitrary HTML/JS code.",
