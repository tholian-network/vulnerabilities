  "notes": "It was introduced by:\r\n\r\n 2677d20677314101293e6da0094ede7b5526d2b1 \"dccp: don't free\r\n ccid2_hc_tx_sock struct in dccp_disconnect()\"\r\n\r\nProposed fixes have been posted to:\r\n  https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20201013171849.236025-1-kleber.souza@canonical.com/T/\r\n\r\nTo mitigate this on systems that have DCCP enabled but do not use it, block module autoloading via adding the following to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-dccp.conf:\r\n\r\n   alias net-pf-2-proto-0-type-6 off\r\n   alias net-pf-2-proto-33-type-6 off\r\n   alias net-pf-10-proto-0-type-6 off\r\n   alias net-pf-10-proto-33-type-6 off\r\n\r\nAlternatively, to prevent the dccp module from being loaded entirely, add:\r\n\r\n  blacklist dccp\r\n  install dccp /bin/false"
