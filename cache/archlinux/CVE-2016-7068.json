	"name": "CVE-2016-7068",
	"type": "denial of service",
	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "An issue has been found in PowerDNS allowing a remote, unauthenticated attacker to cause an abnormal CPU usage load on the PowerDNS server by sending crafted DNS queries, which might result in a partial denial of service if the system becomes overloaded. This issue is based on the fact that the PowerDNS server parses all records present in a query regardless of whether they are needed or even legitimate. A specially crafted query containing a large number of records can be used to take advantage of that behaviour.",
