  "type": "arbitrary code execution",
  "severity": "Low",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "A security issue was found in Exiv2 in versions before version 0.27.4. Improper input validation of the rawData.size property in Jp2Image::readMetadata() in jp2image.cpp can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow via a crafted JPG image containing malicious EXIF data. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to gain code execution, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file.",
