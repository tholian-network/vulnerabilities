	"type": "information disclosure",
	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "A buffer over-read exists in curl >= 7.20.0 and < 7.59.0 in the RTSP+RTP handling code that allows an attacker to cause a denial of service or information leakage. When asked to transfer an RTSP URL, curl could calculate a wrong data length to copy from the read buffer. The memcpy call would copy data from the heap following the buffer to a storage area that would subsequently be delivered to the application (if it didn't cause a crash). This could lead to information leakage or a denial of service for the application if the server offering the RTSP data can trigger this.",
