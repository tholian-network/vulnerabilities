	"name": "CVE-2015-8869",
	"type": "information disclosure",
	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "OCaml versions 4.02.3 and earlier have a runtime bug that, on 64-bit platforms, causes sizes arguments to an internal memmove call to be sign-extended from 32 to 64-bits before being passed to the memmove function.\nThis leads arguments between 2GiB and 4GiB to be interpreted as larger than they are (specifically, a bit below 2^64), causing a buffer overflow. Arguments between 4GiB and 6GiB are interpreted as 4GiB smaller than they should be, causing a possible information leak.",
