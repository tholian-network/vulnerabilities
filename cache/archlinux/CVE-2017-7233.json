  "name": "CVE-2017-7233",
  "type": "cross-site scripting",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "Django relies on user input in some cases (e.g. django.contrib.auth.views.login() and i18n) to redirect the user to an \u201con success\u201d URL. The security check for these redirects (namely django.utils.http.is_safe_url()) considered some numeric URLs (e.g. http:999999999) \u201csafe\u201d when they shouldn\u2019t be.\r\nAlso, if a developer relies on is_safe_url() to provide safe redirect targets and puts such a URL into a link, they could suffer from an XSS attack.",
