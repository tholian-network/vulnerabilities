	"name": "CVE-2017-7233",
	"type": "cross-site scripting",
	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "Django relies on user input in some cases (e.g. django.contrib.auth.views.login() and i18n) to redirect the user to an “on success” URL. The security check for these redirects (namely django.utils.http.is_safe_url()) considered some numeric URLs (e.g. http:999999999) “safe” when they shouldn’t be.\r\nAlso, if a developer relies on is_safe_url() to provide safe redirect targets and puts such a URL into a link, they could suffer from an XSS attack.",
