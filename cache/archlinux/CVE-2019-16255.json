  "name": "CVE-2019-16255",
  "type": "arbitrary code execution",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "It has been discovered that Ruby before 2.4.8, 2.5.7 and 2.6.5 is vulnerable to code injection. Shell#[] and its alias Shell#test defined in lib/shell.rb allow code injection if the first argument (aka the \u201ccommand\u201d argument) is untrusted data. An attacker can exploit this to call an arbitrary Ruby method.",

  "notes": "Note that passing untrusted data to methods of Shell is dangerous in general. Users must never do it. However, we treat this particular case as a vulnerability because the purpose of Shell#[] and Shell#[] is considered file testing."
