	"type": "denial of service",
	"severity": "High",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "A defect in BIND's handling of responses containing a DNAME answer can cause a resolver to exit after encountering an assertion failure in db.c or resolver.c\n\nDuring processing of a recursive response that contains a DNAME record in the answer section, BIND can stop execution after encountering an assertion error in resolver.c (error message: \"INSIST((valoptions & 0x0002U) != 0) failed\") or db.c (error message: \"REQUIRE(targetp != ((void *)0) && *targetp == ((void *)0)) failed\").\n\nA server encountering either of these error conditions will stop, resulting in denial of service to clients.  The risk to authoritative servers is minimal; recursive servers are chiefly at risk.",
