	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "Hiredis before version 1.0.1 is vulnurable to integer overflow if provided maliciously crafted or corrupted RESP mult-bulk protocol data.\r\n\r\nWhen parsing multi-bulk (array-like) replies, hiredis fails to check if count * sizeof(redisReply*) can be represented in SIZE_MAX. If it can not, and the calloc() call doesn't itself make this check, it would result in a short allocation and subsequent buffer overflow.\r\n\r\nUsers of hiredis who are unable to update may set the maxelements context option to a value small enough that no overflow is possible.",
