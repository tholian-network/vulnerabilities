  "name": "CVE-2018-1283",
  "type": "session hijacking",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "In Apache httpd 2.2.0 before 2.4.30, when mod_session is configured to forward its session data to CGI applications (SessionEnv on, not the default), a remote user may influence their content by using a \"Session\" header. This comes from the \"HTTP_SESSION\" variable name used by mod_session to forward its data to CGIs, since the prefix \"HTTP_\" is also used by the Apache HTTP Server to pass HTTP header fields, per CGI specifications.",
