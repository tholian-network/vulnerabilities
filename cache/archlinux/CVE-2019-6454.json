  "description": "It was found that bus_process_object() in bus-objects.c allocates a buffer on the stack large enough to temporarily store the object path specified in the incoming message. A malicious unprivileged local user to send a message which results in the stack pointer moving outside of the bounds of the currently mapped stack region, jumping over the stack guard pages. A specifically crafted DBUS message could crash PID 1 and result in a subsequent kernel panic.",
