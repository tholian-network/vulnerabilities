	"description": "A security issue was found in Firefox before version 86.0. One phishing tactic on the web is to provide a link with HTTP Auth. For example https://www.phishingtarget.com@evil.com. To mitigate this type of attack, Firefox will display a warning dialog; however, this warning dialog would not have been displayed if evil.com used a redirect that was cached by the browser.",
