	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "A bug was found in the Docker CLI where running docker login my-private-registry.example.com with a misconfigured configuration file (typically ~/.docker/config.json) listing a credsStore or credHelpers that could not be executed would result in any provided credentials being sent to registry-1.docker.io rather than the intended private registry.\r\n\r\nThis bug has been fixed in Docker CLI 20.10.9. For users unable to update ensure that any configured credsStore or credHelpers entries in the configuration file reference an installed credential helper that is executable and on the PATH.",
