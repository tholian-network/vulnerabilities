  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "In Firefox before 68.0, until explicitly accessed by script, window.globalThis is not enumerable and, as a result, is not visible to code such as Object.getOwnPropertyNames(window). Sites that deploy a sandboxing that depends on enumerating and freezing access to the window object may miss this, allowing their sandboxes to be bypassed.",
