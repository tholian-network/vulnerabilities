  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "Multiple exploitable denial-of-service vulnerabilities exist in the resource allocation handling of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When encountering errors while parsing mDNS messages, some allocated data is not freed, possibly leading to a denial-of-service condition via resource exhaustion. An attacker can send one mDNS message repeatedly to trigger these vulnerabilities.",
