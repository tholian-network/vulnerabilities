	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "A security issue was found in python-eventlet before version 0.31.0. A websocket peer may exhaust memory on the Eventlet side by sending very large websocket frames. A malicious peer may exhaust memory on the Eventlet side by sending highly compressed data frames. A patch in version 0.31.0 restricts websocket frames to reasonable limits. As a workaround, restricting memory usage via OS limits would help against overall machine exhaustion, but there is no workaround to protect the Eventlet process.",
