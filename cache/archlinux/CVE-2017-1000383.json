  "description": "This CVE assignment is nonsense, GNU emacs reuses the umask of the original file when creating a backup file. That's hardly incorrect behaviour\r\nUpstream report: https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=29182\r\n\r\nGNU Emacs version 25.3.1 (and other versions most likely) ignores umask when creating a backup save file (\"[ORIGINAL_FILENAME]~\") resulting in files that may be world readable or otherwise accessible in ways not intended by the user running the emacs binary. An attacker might search for emacs backup save files in order to retrieve security sensible data.",
