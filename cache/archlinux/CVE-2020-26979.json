	"type": "content spoofing",
	"severity": "Low",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "A security issue was discovered in Firefox before 84.0. When a user typed a URL in the address bar or the search bar and quickly hit the enter key, a website could sometimes capture that event and then redirect the user before navigation occurred to the desired, entered address. To construct a convincing spoof the attacker would have had to guess what the user was typing, perhaps by suggesting it.",
