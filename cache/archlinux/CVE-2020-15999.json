	"description": "A heap buffer overflow has been found in freetype2 before 2.10.4. Malformed TTF files with PNG sbit glyphs can cause a heap buffer overflow in Load_SBit_Png as libpng uses the original 32-bit values, which are saved in png_struct. If the original width and/or height are greater than 65535, the allocated buffer won't be able to fit the bitmap.",
