  "description": "A security issue was discovered in dovecot version 2.3.11 up to 2.3.11.3. Mail delivery/parsing crashed when the 10 000th MIME part was message/rfc822 (or if its parent was multipart/digest). This happened due to earlier MIME parsing changes for CVE-2020-12100. Malicious senders could crash dovecot repeatedly by sending/uploading messages with more than 10 000 MIME parts. The issue is fixed in dovecot version 2.3.13.",
