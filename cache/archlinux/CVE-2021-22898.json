	"type": "information disclosure",
	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "A security issue has been found in curl before version 7.77.0. curl supports the -t command line option, known as CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS in libcurl. This rarely used option is used to send variable=content pairs to TELNET servers. Due to flaw in the option parser for sending NEW_ENV variables, libcurl could be made to pass on uninitialized data from a stack based buffer to the server. Therefore potentially revealing sensitive internal information to the server using a clear-text network protocol.",
