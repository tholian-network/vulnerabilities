  "name": "CVE-2020-6078",
  "type": "denial of service",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the message-parsing functionality of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When parsing mDNS messages in mdns_recv, the return value of the mdns_read_header function is not checked, leading to an uninitialized variable usage that eventually results in a null pointer dereference, leading to service crash. An attacker can send a series of mDNS messages to trigger this vulnerability.",
