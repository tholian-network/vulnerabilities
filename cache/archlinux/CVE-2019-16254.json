	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "It has been discovered that Ruby before 2.4.8, 2.5.7 and 2.6.5 is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting in WEBrick bundled with Ruby. If a program using WEBrick inserts untrusted input into the response header, an attacker can exploit it to insert a newline character to split a header, and inject malicious content to deceive clients.\r\nThis is the same issue as CVE-2017-17742. The previous fix was incomplete, which addressed the CRLF vector, but did not address an isolated CR or an isolated LF.",
