  "name": "CVE-2016-9422",
  "type": "arbitrary code execution",
  "severity": "High",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "A problem has been discovered when rowspan and colspan are not at least 1. If either one of them is zero and the other is larger than 1, HTT_X and HTT_Y attributes are not set correctly resulting in a wrong calculation of maxcol or maxrow (not including colspan/rowspan). This is leading to a potentially exploitable buffer overflow.",
