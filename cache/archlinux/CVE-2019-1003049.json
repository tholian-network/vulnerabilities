  "description": "A security issue has been found in Jenkins before 2.172, where the fix for SECURITY-901 in Jenkins 2.150.2 and 2.160 did not reject existing remoting-based CLI authentication caches. This means that users who cached their CLI authentication before Jenkins was updated to 2.150.2 and newer, or 2.160 and newer, would remain authenticated.",
