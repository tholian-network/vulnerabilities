	"type": "denial of service",
	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "An issue has been found in PowerDNS Authoritative Server before 4.1.5 and PowerDNS Recursor before 4.1.5. The issue is due to the fact that some memory is allocated before the parsing and is not always properly released if the record is malformed.\r\nIn the authoritative server case, it allows an authorized user to cause a memory leak by inserting a specially crafted record in a zone under their control, then sending a DNS query for that record. In the case of the recursor, it allows a malicious authoritative server to cause a memory leak by sending specially crafted records.",
