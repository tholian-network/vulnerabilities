  "notes": "FIXED:\n2016-11-10 Even Rouault <even.rouault at spatialys.com>                \nlibtiff/tif_strip.c: make TIFFNumberOfStrips() return the td->td_nstrips value when it is non-zero, instead of recomputing it. This is needed in TIFF_STRIPCHOP mode where td_nstrips is modified. Fixes a read outsize of array in tiffsplit (or other utilities using TIFFNumberOfStrips())."
