	"type": "information disclosure",
	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "An out-of-bounds read vulnerability on memory-mapped files in TIFFReadRawStrip1() and TIFFReadRawTile1() when stripoffset is beyond tmsize_t max value was found. The vulnerability allows an attacker to specify a negative index into the file-content buffer and copy data from that position until the end of the buffer. This will allow an attacker to crash the process by accessing unmapped memory and (depending on how LibTIFF is used) might also allow an attacker to leak sensitive information.",
