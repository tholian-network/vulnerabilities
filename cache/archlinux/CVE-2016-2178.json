  "name": "CVE-2016-2178",
  "type": "private key recovery",
  "severity": "High",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "Operations in the DSA signing algorithm should run in constant time in order to avoid side channel attacks. A flaw in the OpenSSL DSA implementation means that a non-constant time codepath is followed for certain operations. This has been demonstrated through a cache-timing attack to be sufficient for an attacker to recover the private DSA key.",
