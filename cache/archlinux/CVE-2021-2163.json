	"description": "A security issue was found in the way the Libraries component of OpenJDK enforced constraints defined in the jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms security property. Verification of a JAR filed signed using a disabled algorithm could succeed in certain cases, leading to bypass of the intended security restrictions. The issue is fixed in versions 16.0.1, 11.0.11, 8u291 and 7u301.",
