	"type": "arbitrary code execution",
	"severity": "Critical",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities were found in the QUIC image decoding process of the SPICE remote display system. More specifically, these flaws reside in the spice-common shared code between the client and server of SPICE. In other words, both the client (spice-gtk) and server are affected by these flaws. A malicious client or server could send specially crafted messages which could result in a process crash or potential code execution scenario. The issues have been fixed in spice (server) version 0.14.90 and spice-gtk (client) version 0.39.",
