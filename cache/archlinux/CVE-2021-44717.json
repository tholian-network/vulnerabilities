  "name": "CVE-2021-44717",
  "type": "incorrect calculation",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "A security issue has been found in go before version 1.17.5. When a Go program running on a Unix system is out of file descriptors and calls syscall.ForkExec (including indirectly by using the os/exec package), syscall.ForkExec can close file descriptor 0 as it fails. If this happens (or can be provoked) repeatedly, it can result in misdirected I/O such as writing network traffic intended for one connection to a different connection, or content intended for one file to a different one.",
