	"type": "denial of service",
	"severity": "Low",
	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.11.3, as used with Xen PV. A certain part of the netback driver lacks necessary treatment of errors such as failed memory allocations (as a result of changes to the handling of grant mapping errors). A host OS denial of service may occur during misbehavior of a networking frontend driver. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-26931. The issue is fixed in kernel versions 5.11.4 and 5.10.21.",
