	"type": "arbitrary code execution",
	"severity": "Low",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "A heap buffer overflow was found in Exiv2 before version 0.27.4. The heap overflow is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to gain code execution, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file.\r\n\r\nNote that this bug is only triggered when writing the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as insert.",
