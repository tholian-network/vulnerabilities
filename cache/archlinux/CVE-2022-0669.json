  "description": "A malicious vhost-user master can attach an unexpected number of fds as ancillary data to VHOST_USER_GET_INFLIGHT_FD / VHOST_USER_SET_INFLIGHT_FD messages that are not closed by the vhost-user slave. By sending such messages continuously, the vhost-user master could exhaust available fd in the vhost-user slave process and lead to a DoS.",
