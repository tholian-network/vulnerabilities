  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "A flaw was discovered in Podman before upstream version 2.0.5. When using the deprecated Varlink API or the Docker-compatible REST API, if multiple containers are created in a short duration, the environment variables from the first containers will get leaked into subsequent containers. An attacker who has control over those subsequent containers may get access to secrets shared with previous containers through environment variables.",
