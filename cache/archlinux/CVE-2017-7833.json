  "name": "CVE-2017-7833",
  "type": "content spoofing",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "Some Arabic and Indic vowel marker characters can be combined with Latin characters in a domain name to eclipse the non-Latin character with some font sets on the addressbar of Firefox before 57.0. The non-Latin character will not be visible to most viewers. This allows for domain spoofing attacks because these combined domain names do not display as punycode.",
