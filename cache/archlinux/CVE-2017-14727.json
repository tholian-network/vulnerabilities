  "description": "It has been discovered that in logger.c in the logger plugin before weechat 1.9.1 the date/time conversion specifiers are expanded after replacing buffer local variables in name of log files. In some cases, this can lead to an error in function strftime and a crash caused by the use of an uninitialized buffer.",
