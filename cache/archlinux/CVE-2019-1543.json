  "description": "An issue has been found in OpenSSL <= 1.1.1b, where an application using ChaCha20-Poly1305 could set a non-default nonce length to be longer than 12 bytes and then mistakenly reuse a nonce.\r\nChaCha20-Poly1305 is an AEAD cipher, and requires a unique nonce input for every encryption operation. RFC 7539 specifies that the nonce value (IV) should be 96 bits (12 bytes). OpenSSL allows a variable nonce length and front pads the nonce with 0 bytes if it is less than 12 bytes. However it also incorrectly allows a nonce to be set of up to 16 bytes. In this case only the last 12 bytes are significant and any additional leading bytes are ignored.",
