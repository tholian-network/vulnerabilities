  "description": "libcurl would reuse a previously created connection even when a TLS or SSH related option had been changed that should have prohibited reuse. libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection pool for subsequent transfers to reuse if one of them matches the setup. However, several TLS and SSH settings were left out from the configuration match checks, making them match too easily.",
