	"name": "CVE-2021-33560",
	"type": "private key recovery",
	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "Libgcrypt before 1.9.3 mishandles ElGamal encryption because it lacks exponent blinding to address a side-channel attack against mpi_powm, and the window size is not chosen appropriately. (There is also an interoperability problem because the selection of the k integer value does not properly consider the differences between basic ElGamal encryption and generalized ElGamal encryption.) This, for example, affects use of ElGamal in OpenPGP.",
