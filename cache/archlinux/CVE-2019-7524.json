	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "A stack-based buffer overflow has been found in Dovecot versions prior to 2.3.5.1. When reading FTS or POP3-UIDL header from dovecot index, the input buffer size is not bound, and data is copied to target structure causing stack overflow. This can be used for local root privilege escalation or executing arbitrary code in dovecot process context. This requires ability to directly modify dovecot indexes.",
