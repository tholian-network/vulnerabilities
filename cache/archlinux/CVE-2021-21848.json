  "name": "CVE-2021-21848",
  "type": "arbitrary code execution",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "An exploitable integer overflow vulnerability exists within the MPEG-4 decoding functionality of the GPAC Project on Advanced Content library v1.0.1. The library will actually reuse the parser for atoms with the 'stsz' FOURCC code when parsing atoms that use the 'stz2' FOURCC code and can cause an integer overflow due to unchecked arithmetic resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow that causes memory corruption. An attacker can convince a user to open a video to trigger this vulnerability.",
