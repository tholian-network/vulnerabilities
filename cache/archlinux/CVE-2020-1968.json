  "name": "CVE-2020-1968",
  "type": "private key recovery",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "A flaw was found in openssl in versions 1.0.2 to 1.0.2w. A Raccoon attack exploits a flaw in the TLS specification which can lead to an attacker being able to compute the pre-master secret in connections which have used a Diffie-Hellman (DH) based ciphersuite. In such a case this would result in the attacker being able to eavesdrop on all encrypted communications sent over that TLS connection. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.",
