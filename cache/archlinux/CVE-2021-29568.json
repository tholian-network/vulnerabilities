  "description": "A security issue has been found in TensorFlow before version 2.4.2. An attacker can trigger undefined behavior by binding to null pointer in `tf.raw_ops.ParameterizedTruncatedNormal`. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/3f6fe4dfef6f57e768260b48166c27d148f3015f/tensorflow/core/kernels/parameterized_truncated_normal_op.cc#L630) does not validate input arguments before accessing the first element of `shape`. If `shape` argument is empty, then `shape_tensor.flat<T>()` is an empty array.",
