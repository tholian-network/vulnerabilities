  "description": "It has been discovered that Ruby before 2.4.8, 2.5.7 and 2.6.5 is vulnerable to NUL injection in built-in methods (File.fnmatch and File.fnmatch?). An attacker who has the control of the path pattern parameter could exploit this vulnerability to make path matching pass despite the intention of the program author.\r\nThe Built-in methods File.fnmatch and its alias File.fnmatch? accept the path pattern as their first parameter. When the pattern contains NUL character (\\0), the methods recognize that the path pattern ends immediately before the NUL byte. Therefore, a script that uses an external input as the pattern argument, an attacker can make it wrongly match a pathname that is the second parameter.",
