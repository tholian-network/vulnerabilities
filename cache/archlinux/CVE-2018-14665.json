  "name": "CVE-2018-14665",
  "type": "privilege escalation",
  "severity": "High",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "Incorrect command-line parameter validation in the Xorg X server can lead to privilege elevation and/or arbitrary files overwrite, when the X server is installed with the setuid bit set and unprivileged users have the ability to log in to the system via physical console.\r\n\r\nThe -modulepath argument can be used to specify an insecure path to modules that are going to be loaded in the X server, allowing to execute unprivileged code in the privileged process.\r\n\r\nThe -logfile argument can be used to overwrite arbitrary files in the file system, due to incorrect checks in the parsing of the option.",
