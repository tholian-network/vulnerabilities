  "name": "CVE-2018-0739",
  "type": "denial of service",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Local",
  "description": "A stack-exhaustion issue has been found in OpenSSL <= 1.1.0h, where constructed ASN.1 types with a recursive definition (such as can be found in PKCS7) could eventually exceed the stack given malicious input with excessive recursion. This could result in a Denial Of Service attack. There are no such structures used within SSL/TLS that come from untrusted sources so this is considered safe.",
