  "type": "arbitrary code execution",
  "severity": "High",
  "vector": "Remote",
  "description": "libESMTP before version 1.1.0 mishandles domain copying into a fixed-size buffer in ntlm_build_type_2 in ntlm/ntlmstruct.c. During NTLM authentication, a sufficiently long domain, workstation or user name would overwrite the stack. Furthermore, nt_unicode() is called with an incorrect length argument, potentially causing it to read uninitialised memory or possibly a SIGSEGV or SIGBUS under the same circumstances.",
