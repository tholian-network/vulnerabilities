  "name": "CVE-2019-12210",
  "type": "information disclosure",
  "severity": "Medium",
  "vector": "Local",
  "description": "A file descriptor leak has been found in pam-u2f before 1.8.0. If the `debug` and `debug_file` options are set then the opened debug file will be inherited to the successfully authenticated user's process. Therefore this user can write further information to it, possibly filling up a privileged file system or manipulating the information found in the debug file.\r\nThis can leak sensitive information and also, if written to, be used to fill the disk or plant misinformation.",
