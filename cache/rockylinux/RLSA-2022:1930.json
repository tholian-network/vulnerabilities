		"description": "The keepalived utility provides simple and robust facilities for load balancing and high availability. The load balancing framework relies on the well-known and widely used IP Virtual Server (IPVS) kernel module providing layer-4 (transport layer) load balancing. Keepalived implements a set of checkers to dynamically and adaptively maintain and manage a load balanced server pool according to the health of the servers. Keepalived also implements the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRPv2) to achieve high availability with director failover.\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\nAdditional Changes:\nFor detailed information on changes in this release, see the Rocky Linux 8.6 Release Notes linked from the References section.",
