{
	"identifier": "CVE-2023-20047",
	"description": "A vulnerability in the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) feature of Cisco Webex Room Phone and Cisco Webex Share devices could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient resource allocation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted LLDP traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust the memory resources of the affected device, resulting in a crash of the LLDP process. If the affected device is configured to support LLDP only, this could cause an interruption to inbound and outbound calling. By default, these devices are configured to support both Cisco Discovery Protocol and LLDP. To recover operational state, the affected device needs a manual restart.",
