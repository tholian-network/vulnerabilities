{
	"identifier": "CVE-2021-32845",
	"description": "HyperKit is a toolkit for embedding hypervisor capabilities in an application. In versions 0.20210107 and prior of HyperKit, the implementation of 'qnotify' at 'pci_vtrnd_notify' fails to check the return value of 'vq_getchain'. This leads to 'struct iovec iov;' being uninitialized and used to read memory in 'len = (int) read(sc-\u003evrsc_fd, iov.iov_base, iov.iov_len);' when an attacker is able to make 'vq_getchain' fail. This issue may lead to a guest crashing the host causing a denial of service and, under certain circumstance, memory corruption. This issue is fixed in commit 41272a980197917df8e58ff90642d14dec8fe948.",
