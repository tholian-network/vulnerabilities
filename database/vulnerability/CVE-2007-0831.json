	"identifier": "CVE-2007-0831",
	"description": "** DISPUTED ** Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Atsphp 5.0.1 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the CONF[path] parameter to (1) index.php, (2) sources/usercp.php, or (3) sources/admin.php.  NOTE: Another researcher has disputed this vulnerability, noting that CONF[path] is defined before use in index.php, that CONF[path] inclusion cannot occur through a direct request to other affected files, and that usercp.php is a typo of user_cp.php.",
