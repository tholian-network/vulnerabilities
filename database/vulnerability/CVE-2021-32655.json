	"identifier": "CVE-2021-32655",
	"description": "A security issue has been found in Nextcloud Server before version 21.0.2. An attacker is able to convert a Files Drop link to a federated share. This causes an issue on the UI side of the sharing user. When the sharing user opens the sharing panel and tries to remove the \"Create\" privileges of this unexpected share, Nextcloud server would silently grant the share read privileges.",
