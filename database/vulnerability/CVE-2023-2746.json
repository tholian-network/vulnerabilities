{
	"identifier": "CVE-2023-2746",
	"description": "The Rockwell Automation Enhanced HIM software contains an API that the application uses that is not protected sufficiently and uses incorrect Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings and, as a result, is vulnerable to a Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. To exploit this vulnerability, a malicious user would have to convince a user to click on an untrusted link through a social engineering attack or successfully perform a Cross Site Scripting Attack (XSS). Exploitation of a CSRF could potentially lead to sensitive information disclosure and full remote access to the affected products.",
