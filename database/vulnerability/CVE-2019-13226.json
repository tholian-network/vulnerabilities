{
	"identifier": "CVE-2019-13226",
	"description": "deepin-clone before 1.1.3 uses a predictable path /tmp/.deepin-clone/mount/\u003cblock-dev-basename\u003e in the Helper::temporaryMountDevice() function to temporarily mount a file system as root. An unprivileged user can prepare a symlink at this location to have the file system mounted in an arbitrary location. By winning a race condition, the attacker can also enter the mount point, thereby preventing a subsequent unmount of the file system.",
