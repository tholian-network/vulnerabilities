{
	"identifier": "CVE-2022-30269",
	"description": "Motorola ACE1000 RTUs through 2022-05-02 mishandle application integrity. They allow for custom application installation via either STS software, the C toolkit, or the ACE1000 Easy Configurator. In the case of the Easy Configurator, application images (as PLX/DAT/APP/CRC files) are uploaded via the Web UI. In case of the C toolkit, they are transferred and installed using SFTP/SSH. In each case, application images were found to have no authentication (in the form of firmware signing) and only relied on insecure checksums for regular integrity checks.",
