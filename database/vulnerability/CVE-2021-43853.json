	"identifier": "CVE-2021-43853",
	"description": "Ajax.NET Professional (AjaxPro) is an AJAX framework available for Microsoft ASP.NET. Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to JavaScript object injection which may result in cross site scripting when leveraged by a malicious user. The affected core relates to JavaScript object creation when parsing json input. Releases before version 21.12.22.1 are affected. A workaround exists that replaces one of the core JavaScript files embedded in the library. See the GHSA-5q7q-qqw2-hjq7 for workaround details.",
