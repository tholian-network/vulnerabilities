	"description": "** DISPUTED **  EMC VMware Player allows user-assisted attackers to cause a denial of service (unrecoverable application failure) via a long value of the ide1:0.fileName parameter in the .vmx file of a virtual machine.  NOTE: third parties have disputed this issue, saying that write access to the .vmx file enables other ways of stopping the virtual machine, so no privilege boundaries are crossed.",
