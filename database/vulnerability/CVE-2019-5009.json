	"identifier": "CVE-2019-5009",
	"description": "Vtiger CRM 7.1.0 before Hotfix2 allows uploading files with the extension \"php3\" in the logo upload field, if the uploaded file is in PNG format and has a size of 150x40. One can put PHP code into the image; PHP code can be executed using \"\u003c? ?\u003e\" tags, as demonstrated by a CompanyDetailsSave action. This bypasses the bad-file-extensions protection mechanism. It is related to actions/CompanyDetailsSave.php, actions/UpdateCompanyLogo.php, and models/CompanyDetails.php.",
