	"identifier": "CVE-2023-32323",
	"description": "Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by the Matrix.org Foundation. A malicious user on a Synapse homeserver X with permission to create certain state events can disable outbound federation from X to an arbitrary homeserver Y. Synapse instances with federation disabled are not affected. In versions of Synapse up to and including 1.73, Synapse did not limit the size of 'invite_room_state', meaning that it was possible to create an arbitrarily large invite event. Synapse 1.74 refuses to create oversized 'invite_room_state' fields. Server operators should upgrade to Synapse 1.74 or newer urgently.",
