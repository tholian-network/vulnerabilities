{
	"identifier": "CVE-2020-15199",
	"description": "In Tensorflow before version 2.3.1, the 'RaggedCountSparseOutput' does not validate that the input arguments form a valid ragged tensor. In particular, there is no validation that the 'splits' tensor has the minimum required number of elements. Code uses this quantity to initialize a different data structure. Since 'BatchedMap' is equivalent to a vector, it needs to have at least one element to not be 'nullptr'. If user passes a 'splits' tensor that is empty or has exactly one element, we get a 'SIGABRT' signal raised by the operating system. The issue is patched in commit 3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02 and is released in TensorFlow version 2.3.1.",
