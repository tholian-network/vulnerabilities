This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted H.323 traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to either reboot normally or reboot into maintenance mode, which could result in a DoS condition on the device.",
