{
	"identifier": "CVE-2020-15198",
	"description": "In Tensorflow before version 2.3.1, the 'SparseCountSparseOutput' implementation does not validate that the input arguments form a valid sparse tensor. In particular, there is no validation that the 'indices' tensor has the same shape as the 'values' one. The values in these tensors are always accessed in parallel. Thus, a shape mismatch can result in accesses outside the bounds of heap allocated buffers. The issue is patched in commit 3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02 and is released in TensorFlow version 2.3.1.",
