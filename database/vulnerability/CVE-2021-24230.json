	"identifier": "CVE-2021-24230",
	"description": "The Jetpack Scan team identified a Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability in the Patreon WordPress plugin before 1.7.0, allowing attackers to make a logged in user overwrite or create arbitrary user metadata on the victims account once visited. If exploited, this bug can be used to overwrite the wp_capabilities meta, which contains the affected user accounts roles and privileges. Doing this would essentially lock them out of the site, blocking them from accessing paid content.",
