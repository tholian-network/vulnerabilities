{
	"identifier": "CVE-2021-39224",
	"description": "Nextcloud is an open-source, self-hosted productivity platform. The Nextcloud OfficeOnline application prior to version 1.1.1 returned verbatim exception messages to the user. This could result in a full path disclosure on shared files. (e.g. an attacker could see that the file `shared.txt` is located within `/files/$username/Myfolder/Mysubfolder/shared.txt`). It is recommended that the OfficeOnline application is upgraded to 1.1.1. As a workaround, one may disable the OfficeOnline application in the app settings.",
