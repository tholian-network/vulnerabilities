	"description": "MySQL, when running on Windows, allows remote authenticated users with insert privileges on the mysql.func table to cause a denial of service (server hang) and possibly execute arbitrary code via (1) a request for a non-library file, which causes the Windows LoadLibraryEx function to block, or (2) a request for a function in a library that has the XXX_deinit or XXX_init functions defined but is not tailored for mySQL, such as jpeg1x32.dll and jpeg2x32.dll.",
