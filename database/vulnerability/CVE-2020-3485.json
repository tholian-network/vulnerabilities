{
	"identifier": "CVE-2020-3485",
	"description": "A vulnerability in the role-based access control (RBAC) functionality of the web management software of Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access resources that they should not be able to access and perform actions that they should not be able to perform. The vulnerability exists because the web management software does not properly handle RBAC. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view and delete certain screen content on the system that the attacker would not normally have privileges to access.",
