	"description": "A denial-of-service vulnerability in Database Security (DBS) prior to 4.8.4 allows a remote authenticated administrator to trigger a denial-of-service attack against the DBS server. The configuration of Archiving through the User interface incorrectly allowed the creation of directories and files in Windows system directories and other locations where sensitive data could be overwritten. The former could lead to a DoS, whilst the latter could lead to data destruction on the DBS server.",
