	"description": "** DISPUTED **  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the vendor.  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in register.php for unknown versions of vBulletin allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTML or web script via the reg_site (or possibly regsite) parameter.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this issue, saying \"There is no hidden field called 'reg_site', nor any $reg_site variable anywhere in the vBulletin 2 or vBulletin 3 source code or templates, nor has it ever existed.  We can only assume that this vulnerability was found in a site running code modified from that supplied by Jelsoft.\"",
