{
	"identifier": "CVE-2006-5763",
	"description": "Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Free File Hosting 1.1, and possibly earlier, when register_globals is enabled, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the AD_BODY_TEMP parameter to (1) login.php, (2) register.php, or (3) send.php.  NOTE: the original provenance of this information is unknown; the details are obtained solely from third party information. NOTE: this issue was later reported for the \"File Upload System\" which is a component of Free File Hosting.  Vector 1 also affects Free Image Hosting 2.0, which contains the same code.",
