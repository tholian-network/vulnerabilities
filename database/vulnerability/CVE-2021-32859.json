	"identifier": "CVE-2021-32859",
	"description": "The Baremetrics date range picker is a solution for selecting both date ranges and single dates from a single calender view. Versions 1.0.14 and prior are prone to cross-site scripting (XSS) when handling untrusted 'placeholder' entries. An attacker who is able to influence the field 'placeholder' when creating a 'Calendar' instance is able to supply arbitrary 'html' or 'javascript' that will be rendered in the context of a user leading to XSS. There are no known patches for this issue.",
