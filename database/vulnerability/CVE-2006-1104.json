	"identifier": "CVE-2006-1104",
	"description": "Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Pixelpost 1.5 beta 1 and earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via (1) the showimage parameter in index.php; and the (2) USER_AGENT, (3) HTTP_REFERER, and (4) HTTP_HOST HTTP header fields as used in the book_vistor function in includes/functions.php.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed some issues from the original disclosure, but due to the vagueness of the dispute, it is not clear whether the vendor is disputing this particular issue.",
