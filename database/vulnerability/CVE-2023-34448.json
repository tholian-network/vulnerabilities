	"description": "Grav is a flat-file content management system. Prior to version 1.7.42, the patch for CVE-2022-2073, a server-side template injection vulnerability in Grav leveraging the default 'filter()' function, did not block other built-in functions exposed by Twig's Core Extension that could be used to invoke arbitrary unsafe functions, thereby allowing for remote code execution. A patch in version 1.74.2 overrides the built-in Twig 'map()' and 'reduce()' filter functions in 'system/src/Grav/Common/Twig/Extension/GravExtension.php' to validate the argument passed to the filter in '$arrow'.",
