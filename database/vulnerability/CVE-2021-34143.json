	"identifier": "CVE-2021-34143",
	"description": "The Bluetooth Classic implementation in the Zhuhai Jieli AC6366C_DEMO_V1.0 does not properly handle the reception of continuous unsolicited LMP responses, allowing attackers in radio range to trigger a denial of service (deadlock) of the device by flooding it with LMP_AU_Rand packets after paging procedure. User intervention is required to restart the device.",
