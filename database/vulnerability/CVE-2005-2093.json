	"description": "Oracle 9i Application Server (Oracle9iAS) 9.0.2 allows remote attackers to poison the web cache, bypass web application firewall protection, and conduct XSS attacks via an HTTP request with both a \"Transfer-Encoding: chunked\" header and a Content-Length header, which causes Application Server to incorrectly handle and forward the body of the request in a way that causes the receiving server to process it as a separate HTTP request, aka \"HTTP Request Smuggling.\"",
