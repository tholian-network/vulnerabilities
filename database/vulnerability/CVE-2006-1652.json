	"description": "Multiple buffer overflows in (a) UltraVNC (aka Ultr@VNC) 1.0.1 and earlier and (b) tabbed_viewer 1.29 (1) allow user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a malicious server that sends a long string to a client that connects on TCP port 5900, which triggers an overflow in Log::ReallyPrint; and (2) allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (server crash) via a long HTTP GET request to TCP port 5800, which triggers an overflow in VNCLog::ReallyPrint.",
