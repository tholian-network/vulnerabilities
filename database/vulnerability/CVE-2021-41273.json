	"identifier": "CVE-2021-41273",
	"description": "Pterodactyl is an open-source game server management panel built with PHP 7, React, and Go. Due to improperly configured CSRF protections on two routes, a malicious user could execute a CSRF-based attack against the following endpoints: Sending a test email and Generating a node auto-deployment token. At no point would any data be exposed to the malicious user, this would simply trigger email spam to an administrative user, or generate a single auto-deployment token unexpectedly. This token is not revealed to the malicious user, it is simply created unexpectedly in the system. This has been addressed in release '1.6.6'. Users may optionally manually apply the fixes released in v1.6.6 to patch their own systems.",
