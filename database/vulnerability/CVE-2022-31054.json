{
	"identifier": "CVE-2022-31054",
	"description": "Argo Events is an event-driven workflow automation framework for Kubernetes. Prior to version 1.7.1, several 'HandleRoute' endpoints make use of the deprecated 'ioutil.ReadAll()'. 'ioutil.ReadAll()' reads all the data into memory. As such, an attacker who sends a large request to the Argo Events server will be able to crash it and cause denial of service. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo Events version 1.7.1.",
