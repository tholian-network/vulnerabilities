	"identifier": "CVE-2022-20741",
	"description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of the Network Diagrams application for Cisco Secure Network Analytics, formerly Stealthwatch Enterprise, could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.",
