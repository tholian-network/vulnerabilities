{
	"identifier": "CVE-2021-43777",
	"description": "Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In Redash version 10.0 and prior, the implementation of Google Login (via OAuth) incorrectly uses the 'state' parameter to pass the next URL to redirect the user to after login. The 'state' parameter should be used for a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) token, not a static and easily predicted value. This vulnerability does not affect users who do not use Google Login for their instance of Redash. A patch in the 'master' and 'release/10.x.x' branches addresses this by replacing 'Flask-Oauthlib' with 'Authlib' which automatically provides and validates a CSRF token for the state variable. The new implementation stores the next URL on the user session object. As a workaround, one may disable Google Login to mitigate the vulnerability.",
