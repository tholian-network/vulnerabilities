	"identifier": "CVE-2010-1438",
	"description": "Web Application Finger Printer (WAFP) 0.01-26c3 uses fixed pathnames under /tmp for temporary files and directories, which (1) allows local users to cause a denial of service (application outage) by creating a file with a pathname that the product expects is available for its own internal use, (2) allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via symlink attacks on certain files in /tmp, (3) might allow local users to delete arbitrary files and directories via a symlink attack on a directory under /tmp, and (4) might make it easier for local users to obtain sensitive information by reading files in a directory under /tmp, related to (a) lib/wafp_pidify.rb, (b) utils/generate_wafp_fingerprint.sh, (c) utils/online_update.sh, and (d) utils/extract_from_db.sh.",
