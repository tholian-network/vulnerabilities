Prior to versions 1.20.1-1.106.0, 1.19.4-1.106.0, 1.19.2-1.101.3, 1.18.2-1.101.3, and 1.16.5-1.101.3, if the cc-tweaked plugin is running on a Minecraft server hosted on a popular cloud hosting providers, like AWS, GCP, and Azure, those metadata services API endpoints are not forbidden (aka \"blacklisted\") by default.
