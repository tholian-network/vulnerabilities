{
	"identifier": "CVE-2022-24788",
	"description": "Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual machine. Versions of vyper prior to 0.3.2 suffer from a potential buffer overrun. Importing a function from a JSON interface which returns `bytes` generates bytecode which does not clamp bytes length, potentially resulting in a buffer overrun. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
