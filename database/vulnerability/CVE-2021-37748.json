	"description": "Multiple buffer overflows in the limited configuration shell (/sbin/gs_config) on Grandstream HT801 devices before 1.0.29 allow remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code as root via a crafted manage_if setting, thus bypassing the intended restrictions of this shell and taking full control of the device. There are default weak credentials that can be used to authenticate.",
