	"description": "An issue was discovered in Observium Professional, Enterprise \u0026 Community 20.8.10631. It is vulnerable to directory traversal and local file inclusion due to the fact that there is an unrestricted possibility of loading any file with an inc.php extension. Inclusion of other files (even though limited to the mentioned extension) can lead to Remote Code Execution. This can occur via /device/device=345/?tab=ports\u0026view=../ URIs because of device/port.inc.php.",
