	"identifier": "CVE-2021-42581",
	"description": "** DISPUTED ** Prototype poisoning in function mapObjIndexed in Ramda 0.27.0 and earlier allows attackers to compromise integrity or availability of application via supplying a crafted object (that contains an own property \"__proto__\") as an argument to the function. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because the observed behavior only means that a user can create objects that the user didn't know would contain custom prototypes.",
