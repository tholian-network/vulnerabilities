	"identifier": "CVE-2016-8365",
	"description": "OSIsoft PI System software (Applications using PI Asset Framework (AF) Client versions prior to PI AF Client 2016, Version 2.8.0; Applications using PI Software Development Kit (SDK) versions prior to PI SDK 2016, Version 1.4.6; PI Buffer Subsystem, versions prior to and including, Version 4.4; and PI Data Archive versions prior to PI Data Archive 2015, Version 3.4.395.64) operates between endpoints without a complete model of endpoint features potentially causing the product to perform actions based on this incomplete model, which could result in a denial of service. OSIsoft reports that in order to exploit the vulnerability an attacker would need to be locally connected to a server. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)",
