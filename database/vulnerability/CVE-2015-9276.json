	"identifier": "CVE-2015-9276",
	"description": "SmarterTools SmarterMail before 13.3.5535 was vulnerable to stored XSS by bypassing the anti-XSS mechanisms. It was possible to run JavaScript code when a victim user opens or replies to the attacker's email, which contained a malicious payload. Therefore, users' passwords could be reset by using an XSS attack, as the password reset page did not need the current password.",
