{
	"identifier": "CVE-2023-1869",
	"description": "The YourChannel  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in versions up to, and including, 1.2.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrative-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.",
