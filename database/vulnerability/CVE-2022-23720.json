{
	"identifier": "CVE-2022-23720",
	"description": "PingID Windows Login prior to 2.8 does not alert or halt operation if it has been provisioned with the full permissions PingID properties file. An IT administrator could mistakenly deploy administrator privileged PingID API credentials, such as those typically used by PingFederate, into PingID Windows Login user endpoints. Using sensitive full permissions properties file outside of a privileged trust boundary leads to an increased risk of exposure or discovery, and an attacker could leverage these credentials to perform administrative actions against PingID APIs or endpoints.",
