	"description": "Snap One OvrC Pro devices versions 7.2 and prior do not validate firmware updates correctly. The device only calculates the MD5 hash of the firmware and does not check using a private-public key mechanism. The lack of complete PKI system firmware signature could allow attackers to upload arbitrary firmware updates, resulting in code execution.",
