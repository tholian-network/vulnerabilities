{
	"identifier": "CVE-2022-23472",
	"description": "Passeo is an open source python password generator. Versions prior to 1.0.5 rely on the python 'random' library for random value selection. The python 'random' library warns that it should not be used for security purposes due to its reliance on a non-cryptographically secure random number generator. As a result a motivated attacker may be able to guess generated passwords. This issue has been addressed in version 1.0.5. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
