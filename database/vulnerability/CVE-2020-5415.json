{
	"identifier": "CVE-2020-5415",
	"description": "Concourse, versions prior to 6.3.1 and 6.4.1, in installations which use the GitLab auth connector, is vulnerable to identity spoofing by way of configuring a GitLab account with the same full name as another user who is granted access to a Concourse team. GitLab groups do not have this vulnerability, so GitLab users may be moved into groups which are then configured in the Concourse team.",
