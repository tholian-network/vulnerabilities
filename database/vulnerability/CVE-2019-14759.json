{
	"identifier": "CVE-2019-14759",
	"description": "An issue was discovered in KaiOS 1.0, 2.5, and 2.5.1. The pre-installed Radio application is vulnerable to HTML and JavaScript injection attacks. A local attacker can inject arbitrary HTML into the Radio application. At a bare minimum, this allows an attacker to take control over the Radio application's UI (e.g., display a malicious prompt to the user asking them to re-enter credentials such as their KaiOS credentials to continue using the application) and also allows an attacker to abuse any of the privileges available to the mobile application.",
