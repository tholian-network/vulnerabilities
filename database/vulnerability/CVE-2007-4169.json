	"identifier": "CVE-2007-4169",
	"description": "** DISPUTED **  Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in vgallite allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the (1) dirpath parameter to _functions.php or the (2) lang parameter to index.php.  NOTE: CVE disputes vector 1 because the applicable include_once is located in a function that is not called on a direct request, and because $dirpath is an argument to this function.  CVE disputes vector 2 because \"lang\" is a constant string within an include_once, not a variable.  The researcher is also unreliable.",
