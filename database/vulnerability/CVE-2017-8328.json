{
	"identifier": "CVE-2017-8328",
	"description": "An issue was discovered on Securifi Almond, Almond+, and Almond 2015 devices with firmware AL-R096. The device provides a user with the capability of changing the administrative password for the web management interface. It seems that the device does not implement any cross site request forgery protection mechanism which allows an attacker to trick a user who is logged in to the web management interface to change a user's password. Also this is a systemic issue.",
