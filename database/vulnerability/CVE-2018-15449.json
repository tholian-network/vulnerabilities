	"description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Video Surveillance Media Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) of the web-based management interface of an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected service. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the web-based management interface to become unreachable, resulting in a DoS condition.",
