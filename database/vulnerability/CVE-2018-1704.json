	"description": "IBM Platform Symphony 7.1 Fix Pack 1 and 7.1.1 and IBM Spectrum Symphony 7.1.2 and 7.2.0.2 could allow a remote attacker to conduct phishing attacks, using an open redirect attack. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to spoof the URL displayed to redirect a user to a malicious Web site that would appear to be trusted. This could allow the attacker to obtain highly sensitive information or conduct further attacks against the victim. IBM X-Force ID: 146339.",
