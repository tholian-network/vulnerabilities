	"identifier": "CVE-2023-31123",
	"description": "'effectindex/tripreporter' is a community-powered, universal platform for submitting and analyzing trip reports. Prior to commit bd80ba833b9023d39ca22e29874296c8729dd53b, any user with an account on an instance of 'effectindex/tripreporter', e.g. 'subjective.report', may be affected by an improper password verification vulnerability. The vulnerability allows any user with a password matching the password requirements to log in as any user. This allows access to accounts / data loss of the user. This issue is patched in commit bd80ba833b9023d39ca22e29874296c8729dd53b. No action necessary for users of 'subjective.report', and anyone running their own instance should update to this commit or newer as soon as possible. As a workaround, someone running their own instance may apply the patch manually.",
