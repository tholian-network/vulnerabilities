	"identifier": "CVE-2017-9385",
	"description": "An issue was discovered on Vera Veralite 1.7.481 devices. The device has an additional OpenWRT interface in addition to the standard web interface which allows the highest privileges a user can obtain on the device. This web interface uses root as the username and the password in the /etc/cmh/cmh.conf file which can be extracted by an attacker using a directory traversal attack, and then log in to the device with the highest privileges.",
