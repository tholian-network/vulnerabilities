{
	"identifier": "CVE-2023-30629",
	"description": "Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual machine. In versions 0.3.1 through 0.3.7, the Vyper compiler generates the wrong bytecode. Any contract that uses the 'raw_call' with 'revert_on_failure=False' and 'max_outsize=0' receives the wrong response from 'raw_call'. Depending on the memory garbage, the result can be either 'True' or 'False'. A patch is available and, as of time of publication, anticipated to be part of Vyper 0.3.8. As a workaround, one may always put  'max_outsize\u003e0'.",
