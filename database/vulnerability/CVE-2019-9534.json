{
	"identifier": "CVE-2019-9534",
	"description": "The Cobham EXPLORER 710, firmware version 1.07, does not validate its firmware image. Development scripts left in the firmware can be used to upload a custom firmware image that the device runs. This could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker to upload their own firmware that could be used to intercept or modify traffic, spoof or intercept GPS traffic, exfiltrate private data, hide a backdoor, or cause a denial-of-service.",
