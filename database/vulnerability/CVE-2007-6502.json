	"description": "Hosting Controller 6.1 Hot fix 3.3 and earlier allows remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information via (1) the AdminName and AdminLevel parameters to fp2000/NEWSRVR.asp, which discloses usernames; and (2) certain XML HTTP requests to hosting/css.asp using Microsoft.XMLHTTP or MSXML2.XMLHTTP objects, which trigger a response with the setup directory pathname in the HTML source; and (3) might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a request for /admin/forum/, which reveals the path in an error message when a forum is not found.",
