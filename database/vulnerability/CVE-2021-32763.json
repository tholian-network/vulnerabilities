{
	"identifier": "CVE-2021-32763",
	"description": "OpenProject is open-source, web-based project management software. In versions prior to 11.3.3, the 'MessagesController' class of OpenProject has a 'quote' method that implements the logic behind the Quote button in the discussion forums, and it uses a regex to strip '\u003cpre\u003e' tags from the message being quoted. The '(.|\\s)' part can match a space character in two ways, so an unterminated '\u003cpre\u003e' tag containing 'n' spaces causes Ruby's regex engine to backtrack to try 2\u003csup\u003en\u003c/sup\u003e states in the NFA. This will result in a Regular Expression Denial of Service. The issue is fixed in OpenProject 11.3.3. As a workaround, one may install the patch manually.",
