	"description": "The tcp_find_option function of the netfilter subsystem for IPv6 in the SUSE Linux 2.6.5 kernel with USAGI patches, when using iptables and TCP options rules, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption by infinite loop) via a large option length that produces a negative integer after a casting operation to the char type, a similar flaw to CVE-2004-0626.",
