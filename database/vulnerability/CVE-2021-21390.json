{
	"identifier": "CVE-2021-21390",
	"description": "In MinIO before version RELEASE.2021-03-17T02-33-02Z, there is a vulnerability which enables man-in-the-middle (MITM) modification of request bodies that are meant to have integrity guaranteed by chunk signatures. In a PUT request using the aws-chunked encoding, MinIO ordinarily verifies signatures at the end of a chunk. This check can be skipped if the client sends a false chunk size that is much greater than the actual data sent: the server accepts and completes the request without ever reaching the end of the chunk and thereby without ever checking the chunk signature. This is fixed in version RELEASE.2021-03-17T02-33-02Z.",
