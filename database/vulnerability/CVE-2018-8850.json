	"identifier": "CVE-2018-8850",
	"description": "Philips e-Alert Unit (non-medical device), Version R2.1 and prior. The software does not validate input properly, allowing an attacker to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application. This would lead to parts of the unit receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.",
