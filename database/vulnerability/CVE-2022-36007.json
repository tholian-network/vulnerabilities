	"identifier": "CVE-2022-36007",
	"description": "Venice is a Clojure inspired sandboxed Lisp dialect with excellent Java interoperability. A partial path traversal issue exists within the functions `load-file` and `load-resource`. These functions can be limited to load files from a list of load paths. Assuming Venice has been configured with the load paths: `[ \"/Users/foo/resources\" ]` When passing **relative** paths to these two vulnerable functions everything is fine: `(load-resource \"test.png\")` =\u003e loads the file \"/Users/foo/resources/test.png\" `(load-resource \"../resources-alt/test.png\")` =\u003e rejected, outside the load path When passing **absolute** paths to these two vulnerable functions Venice may return files outside the configured load paths: `(load-resource \"/Users/foo/resources/test.png\")` =\u003e loads the file \"/Users/foo/resources/test.png\" `(load-resource \"/Users/foo/resources-alt/test.png\")` =\u003e loads the file \"/Users/foo/resources-alt/test.png\" !!! The latter call suffers from the _Partial Path Traversal_ vulnerability. This issues scope is limited to absolute paths whose name prefix matches a load path. E.g. for a load-path `\"/Users/foo/resources\"`, the actor can cause loading a resource also from `\"/Users/foo/resources-alt\"`, but not from `\"/Users/foo/images\"`. Versions of Venice before and including v1.10.17 are affected by this issue. Upgrade to Venice \u003e= 1.10.18, if you are on a version \u003c 1.10.18. There are currently no known workarounds.",
