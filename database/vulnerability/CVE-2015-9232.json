Also, the Good Dynamic application activation process does not attempt to detect malicious activation attempts involving modified names beginning with a com.good.gdgma substring. Consequently, an attacker could obtain access to intranet data. This issue is only relevant in cases where the user has already downloaded a malicious Android application.",
