{
	"identifier": "CVE-2019-1586",
	"description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker with physical access to obtain sensitive information from an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insecure removal of cleartext encryption keys stored on local partitions in the hard drive of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by retrieving data from the physical disk on the affected partition(s). A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve encryption keys, possibly allowing the attacker to further decrypt other data and sensitive information on the device, which could lead to the disclosure of confidential information.",
