	"identifier": "CVE-2023-32058",
	"description": "Vyper is a Pythonic smart contract language for the Ethereum virtual machine. Prior to version 0.3.8, due to missing overflow check for loop variables, by assigning the iterator of a loop to a variable, it is possible to overflow the type of the latter. The issue seems to happen only in loops of type 'for i in range(a, a + N)' as in loops of type 'for i in range(start, stop)' and 'for i in range(stop)', the compiler is able to raise a 'TypeMismatch' when trying to overflow the variable. The problem has been patched in version 0.3.8.",
