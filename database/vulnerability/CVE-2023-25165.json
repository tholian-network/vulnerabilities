{
	"identifier": "CVE-2023-25165",
	"description": "Helm is a tool that streamlines installing and managing Kubernetes applications.'getHostByName' is a Helm template function introduced in Helm v3. The function is able to accept a hostname and return an IP address for that hostname. To get the IP address the function performs a DNS lookup. The DNS lookup happens when used with 'helm install|upgrade|template' or when the Helm SDK is used to render a chart. Information passed into the chart can be disclosed to the DNS servers used to lookup the IP address. For example, a malicious chart could inject 'getHostByName' into a chart in order to disclose values to a malicious DNS server. The issue has been fixed in Helm 3.11.1. Prior to using a chart with Helm verify the 'getHostByName' function is not being used in a template to disclose any information you do not want passed to DNS servers.",
