{
	"identifier": "CVE-2020-15237",
	"description": "In Shrine before version 3.3.0, when using the 'derivation_endpoint' plugin, it's possible for the attacker to use a timing attack to guess the signature of the derivation URL. The problem has been fixed by comparing sent and calculated signature in constant time, using 'Rack::Utils.secure_compare'. Users using the 'derivation_endpoint' plugin are urged to upgrade to Shrine 3.3.0 or greater. A possible workaround is provided in the linked advisory.",
