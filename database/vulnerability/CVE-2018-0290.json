The vulnerability is due to faulty handling of new TCP connections to the affected application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious TCP packet to the vulnerable service. An exploit could allow the attacker to create a DoS condition by interrupting certain phone services. A manual restart of the service may be required to restore full functionalities.
