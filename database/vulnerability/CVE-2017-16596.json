Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. The specific flaw exists within the org.apache.jsp.u.jsp.designer.script_005fsamples_jsp servlet, which listens on TCP port 8081 by default. When parsing the type parameter, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations.
