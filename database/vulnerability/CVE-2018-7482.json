{
	"identifier": "CVE-2018-7482",
	"description": "** DISPUTED ** The K2 component 2.8.0 for Joomla! has Incorrect Access Control with directory traversal, allowing an attacker to download arbitrary files, as demonstrated by a view=media\u0026task=connector\u0026cmd=file\u0026target=l1_../configuration.php\u0026download=1 request. The specific pathname ../configuration.php should be base64 encoded for a valid attack. NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue because only files under the media-manager path can be downloaded, and the documentation indicates that sensitive information does not belong there. Nonetheless, 2.8.1 has additional blocking of .php downloads.",
