	"description": "The Indeed Job Importer WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient input validation and sanitization via several parameters found in the ~/indeed-job-importer/trunk/indeed-job-importer.php file which allowed attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 1.0.5. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled.",
