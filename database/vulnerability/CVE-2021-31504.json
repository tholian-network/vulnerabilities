	"description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of OpenText Brava! Desktop Build 16.6.3.84 (package 16.6.3.134). User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PDF files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied value prior to dereferencing it as a pointer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-12691.",
