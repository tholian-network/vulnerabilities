	"description": "** DISPUTED ** Technicolor TC7200.20 devices allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (networking outage) via a flood of random MAC addresses, as demonstrated by macof. NOTE: Technicolor denies that the described behavior is a vulnerability and states that Wi-Fi traffic is slowed or stopped only while the devices are exposed to a MAC flooding attack. This has been confirmed through testing against official up-to-date versions.",
