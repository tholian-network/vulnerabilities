The vulnerability is due to improper restrictions on XML entities. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests to an affected system that contain references in XML entities. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve files from the local system, resulting in the disclosure of sensitive information, or cause the application to consume available resources, resulting in a DoS condition.",
