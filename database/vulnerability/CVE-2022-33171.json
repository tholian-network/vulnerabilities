	"description": "** DISPUTED ** The findOne function in TypeORM before 0.3.0 can either be supplied with a string or a FindOneOptions object. When input to the function is a user-controlled parsed JSON object, supplying a crafted FindOneOptions instead of an id string leads to SQL injection. NOTE: the vendor's position is that the user's application is responsible for input validation.",
