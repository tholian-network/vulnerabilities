	"description": "SRS is a real-time video server supporting RTMP, WebRTC, HLS, HTTP-FLV, SRT, MPEG-DASH, and GB28181. Prior to versions 5.0.157, 5.0-b1, and 6.0.48, SRS's 'api-server' server is vulnerable to a drive-by command injection. An attacker may send a request to the '/api/v1/snapshots' endpoint containing any commands to be executed as part of the body of the POST request. This issue may lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE). Versions 5.0.157, 5.0-b1, and 6.0.48 contain a fix.",
