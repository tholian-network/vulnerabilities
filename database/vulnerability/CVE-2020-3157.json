	"identifier": "CVE-2020-3157",
	"description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based interface. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input to the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious configuration and saving it to the targeted system. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information when an administrator views the configuration. An attacker would need write permissions to exploit this vulnerability successfully.",
