	"identifier": "CVE-2022-20869",
	"description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco BroadWorks Application Delivery Platform Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting attack against a user of the interface. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.",
