	"description": "Clearswift MAILsweeper for SMTP before 4.3.20 and MAILsweeper for Exchange before 4.3.20 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via (1) non-ASCII characters in a reverse DNS lookup result from a Received header, which leads to a Receiver service stop, and (2) unspecified vectors involving malformed messages, which causes \"unpredictable behavior\" that prevents the Security service from processing more messages.",
