	"description": "fs2 is a compositional, streaming I/O library for Scala. When establishing a server-mode 'TLSSocket' using 'fs2-io' on Node.js, the parameter 'requestCert = true' is ignored, peer certificate verification is skipped, and the connection proceeds. The vulnerability is limited to: 1. 'fs2-io' running on Node.js. The JVM TLS implementation is completely independent. 2. 'TLSSocket's in server-mode. Client-mode 'TLSSocket's are implemented via a different API. 3. mTLS as enabled via 'requestCert = true' in 'TLSParameters'. The default setting is 'false' for server-mode 'TLSSocket's. It was introduced with the initial Node.js implementation of fs2-io in 3.1.0. A patch is released in v3.2.11. The requestCert = true parameter is respected and the peer certificate is verified. If verification fails, a SSLException is raised. If using an unpatched version on Node.js, do not use a server-mode TLSSocket with requestCert = true to establish a mTLS connection.",
