	"description": "** DISPUTED **  PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in pcltrace.lib.php in the PclTar module in Vincent Blavet PhpConcept Library, as used in CJG EXPLORER PRO 3.3 and earlier and probably other products, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the g_pcltar_lib_dir parameter.  NOTE: CVE disputes this issue since there is no include statement in pcltrace.lib.php.  NOTE: the pcltar.lib.php vector is already covered by CVE-2007-2199.",
