	"identifier": "CVE-2019-5055",
	"description": "An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the Host Access Point Daemon (hostapd) on the NETGEAR N300 (WNR2000v5 with Firmware Version V1.0.0.70) wireless router. A SOAP request sent in an invalid sequence to the \u003cWFAWLANConfig:1#PutMessage\u003e service can cause a null pointer dereference, resulting in the hostapd service crashing. An unauthenticated attacker can send a specially-crafted SOAP request to trigger this vulnerability.",
