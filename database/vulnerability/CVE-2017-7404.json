{
	"identifier": "CVE-2017-7404",
	"description": "On the D-Link DIR-615 before v20.12PTb04, if a victim logged in to the Router's Web Interface visits a malicious site from another Browser tab, the malicious site then can send requests to the victim's Router without knowing the credentials (CSRF). An attacker can host a page that sends a POST request to Form2File.htm that tries to upload Firmware to victim's Router. This causes the router to reboot/crash resulting in Denial of Service. An attacker may succeed in uploading malicious Firmware.",
