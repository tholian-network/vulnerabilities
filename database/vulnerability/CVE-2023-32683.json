{
	"identifier": "CVE-2023-32683",
	"description": "Synapse is a Matrix protocol homeserver written in Python with the Twisted framework. A discovered oEmbed or image URL can bypass the 'url_preview_url_blacklist' setting potentially allowing server side request forgery or bypassing network policies. Impact is limited to IP addresses allowed by the 'url_preview_ip_range_blacklist' setting (by default this only allows public IPs) and by the limited information returned to the client: 1. For discovered oEmbed URLs, any non-JSON response or a JSON response which includes non-oEmbed information is discarded. 2. For discovered image URLs, any non-image response is discarded. Systems which have URL preview disabled (via the 'url_preview_enabled' setting) or have not configured a 'url_preview_url_blacklist' are not affected. This issue has been addressed in version 1.85.0. Users are advised to upgrade. User unable to upgrade may also disable URL previews.",
