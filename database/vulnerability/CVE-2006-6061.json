	"description": "com.apple.AppleDiskImageController in Apple Mac OS X 10.4.8, and possibly other versions, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a malformed DMG image that triggers memory corruption.  NOTE: the severity of this issue has been disputed by a third party, who states that the impact is limited to a denial of service (kernel panic) due to a vm_fault call with a non-aligned address.",
