	"identifier": "CVE-2019-6753",
	"description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader 9.3.0.10826. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of the Stuff method. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer overflow before writing to memory. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-7561.",
