{
	"identifier": "CVE-2023-30542",
	"description": "OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. The proposal creation entrypoint ('propose') in 'GovernorCompatibilityBravo' allows the creation of proposals with a 'signatures' array shorter than the 'calldatas' array. This causes the additional elements of the latter to be ignored, and if the proposal succeeds the corresponding actions would eventually execute without any calldata. The 'ProposalCreated' event correctly represents what will eventually execute, but the proposal parameters as queried through 'getActions' appear to respect the original intended calldata. This issue has been patched in 4.8.3. As a workaround, ensure that all proposals that pass through governance have equal length 'signatures' and 'calldatas' parameters.",
