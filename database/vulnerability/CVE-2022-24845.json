{
	"identifier": "CVE-2022-24845",
	"description": "Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual machine. In affected versions, the return of '\u003ciface\u003e.returns_int128()' is not validated to fall within the bounds of 'int128'. This issue can result in a misinterpretation of the integer value and lead to incorrect behavior. As of v0.3.0, '\u003ciface\u003e.returns_int128()' is validated in simple expressions, but not complex expressions. Users are advised to upgrade. There is no known workaround for this issue.",
