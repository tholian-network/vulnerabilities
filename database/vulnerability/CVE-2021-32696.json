{
	"identifier": "CVE-2021-32696",
	"description": "The npm package \"striptags\" is an implementation of PHP's strip_tags in Typescript. In striptags before version 3.2.0, a type-confusion vulnerability can cause 'striptags' to concatenate unsanitized strings when an array-like object is passed in as the 'html' parameter. This can be abused by an attacker who can control the shape of their input, e.g. if query parameters are passed directly into the function. This can lead to a XSS.",
