	"identifier": "CVE-2018-0164",
	"description": "A vulnerability in the Switch Integrated Security Features of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an interface queue wedge. The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of crafted IPv6 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IPv6 packets through the device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause an interface queue wedge. This vulnerability affects the Cisco cBR-8 Converged Broadband Router, Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers, and Cisco Cloud Services Router 1000V Series when configured with IPv6. In the field and internal testing, this vulnerability was only observed or reproduced on the Cisco cBR-8 Converged Broadband Router. The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers and Cisco Cloud Services Router 1000V Series contain the same code logic, so affected trains have had the code fix applied; however, on these two products, the vulnerability has not been observed in the field or successfully reproduced internally.
