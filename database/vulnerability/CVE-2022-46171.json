{
	"identifier": "CVE-2022-46171",
	"description": "Tauri is a framework for building binaries for all major desktop platforms. The filesystem glob pattern wildcards `*`, `?`, and `[...]` match file path literals and leading dots by default, which unintentionally exposes sub folder content of allowed paths. Scopes without the wildcards are not affected. As `**` allows for sub directories the behavior there is also as expected. The issue has been patched in the latest release and was backported into the currently supported 1.x branches. There are no known workarounds at the time of publication.",
