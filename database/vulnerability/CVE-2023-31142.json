	"identifier": "CVE-2023-31142",
	"description": "Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.0.4 of the 'stable' branch and version 3.1.0.beta5 of the 'beta' and 'tests-passed' branches, if a site has modified their general category permissions, they could be set back to the default. This issue is patched in version 3.0.4 of the 'stable' branch and version 3.1.0.beta5 of the 'beta' and 'tests-passed' branches. A workaround, only if you are modifying the general category permissions, is to use a new category for the same purpose.",
