{
	"identifier": "CVE-2023-32696",
	"description": "CKAN is an open-source data management system for powering data hubs and data portals. Prior to versions 2.9.9 and 2.10.1, the 'ckan' user (equivalent to www-data) owned code and configuration files in the docker container and the 'ckan' user had the permissions to use sudo. These issues allowed for code execution or privilege escalation if an arbitrary file write bug was available. Versions 2.9.9, 2.9.9-dev, 2.10.1, and 2.10.1-dev contain a patch.",
