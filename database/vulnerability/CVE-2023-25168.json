	"identifier": "CVE-2023-25168",
	"description": "Wings is Pterodactyl's server control plane. This vulnerability can be used to delete files and directories recursively on the host system. This vulnerability can be combined with 'GHSA-p8r3-83r8-jwj5' to overwrite files on the host system. In order to use this exploit, an attacker must have an existing \"server\" allocated and controlled by Wings. This vulnerability has been resolved in version 'v1.11.4' of Wings, and has been back-ported to the 1.7 release series in 'v1.7.4'. Anyone running 'v1.11.x' should upgrade to 'v1.11.4' and anyone running 'v1.7.x' should upgrade to 'v1.7.4'. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
