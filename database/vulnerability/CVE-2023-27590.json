{
	"identifier": "CVE-2023-27590",
	"description": "Rizin is a UNIX-like reverse engineering framework and command-line toolset. In version 0.5.1 and prior, converting a GDB registers profile file into a Rizin register profile can result in a stack-based buffer overflow when the 'name', 'type', or 'groups' fields have longer values than expected. Users opening untrusted GDB registers files (e.g. with the 'drpg' or 'arpg' commands) are affected by this flaw. Commit d6196703d89c84467b600ba2692534579dc25ed4 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, review the GDB register profiles before loading them with 'drpg'/'arpg' commands.",
