	"identifier": "CVE-2020-14933",
	"description": "** DISPUTED ** compose.php in SquirrelMail 1.4.22 calls unserialize for the $attachments value, which originates from an HTTP POST request. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because these two conditions for PHP object injection are not satisfied: existence of a PHP magic method (such as __wakeup or __destruct), and any attack-relevant classes must be declared before unserialize is called (or must be autoloaded). .",
