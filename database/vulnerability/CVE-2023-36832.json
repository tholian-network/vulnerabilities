	"identifier": "CVE-2023-36832",
	"description": "An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in packet processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker to send specific packets to an Aggregated Multiservices (AMS) interface on the device, causing the packet forwarding engine (PFE) to crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).  Continued receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.This issue is only triggered by packets destined to a local-interface via a service-interface (AMS).  AMS is only supported on the MS-MPC, MS-MIC, and MX-SPC3 cards.  This issue is not experienced on other types of interfaces or configurations.  Additionally, transit traffic does not trigger this issue.This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series:All versions prior to 19.1R3-S10;19.2 versions prior to 19.2R3-S7;19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S8;19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S12;20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S8;20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S7;21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S5;21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S5;21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S4;21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-S3;22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3-S2;22.2 versions prior to 22.2R3;22.3 versions prior to 22.3R2-S1, 22.3R3;22.4 versions prior to 22.4R1-S2, 22.4R2.",
