	"description": "OpenFGA is an authorization/permission engine. Prior to version 0.2.4, the 'streamed-list-objects' endpoint was not validating the authorization header, resulting in disclosure of objects in the store. Users 'openfga/openfga' versions 0.2.3 and prior who are exposing the OpenFGA service to the internet are vulnerable. Version 0.2.4 contains a patch for this issue.",
