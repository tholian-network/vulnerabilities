{
	"identifier": "CVE-2020-25276",
	"description": "An issue was discovered in PrimeKey EJBCA 6.x and 7.x before 7.4.1. When using a client certificate to enroll over the EST protocol, no revocation check is performed on that certificate. This vulnerability can only affect a system that has EST configured, uses client certificates to authenticate enrollment, and has had such a certificate revoked. This certificate needs to belong to a role that is authorized to enroll new end entities. (To completely mitigate this problem prior to upgrade, remove any revoked client certificates from their respective roles.)",
