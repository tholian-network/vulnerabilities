{
	"identifier": "CVE-2022-23592",
	"description": "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. TensorFlow's type inference can cause a heap out of bounds read as the bounds checking is done in a `DCHECK` (which is a no-op during production). An attacker can control the `input_idx` variable such that `ix` would be larger than the number of values in `node_t.args`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. This is the only affected version.",
