{
	"identifier": "CVE-2022-34322",
	"description": "Multiple XSS issues were discovered in Sage Enterprise Intelligence 2021 R1.1 that allow an attacker to execute JavaScript code in the context of users' browsers. The attacker needs to be authenticated to reach the vulnerable features. An issue is present in the Notify Users About Modification menu and the Notifications feature. A user can send malicious notifications and execute JavaScript code in the browser of every user who has enabled notifications. This is a stored XSS, and can lead to privilege escalation in the context of the application. (Another issue is present in the Favorites tab. The name of a favorite or a folder of favorites is interpreted as HTML, and can thus embed JavaScript code, which is executed when displayed. This is a self-XSS.)",
