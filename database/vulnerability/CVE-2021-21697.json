{
	"identifier": "CVE-2021-21697",
	"description": "Agents are allowed some limited access to files on the Jenkins controller file system. The directories agents are allowed to access in Jenkins before 2.319 include the directories storing build-related information, intended to allow agents to store build-related metadata during build execution. As a consequence, this allows any agent to read and write the contents of any build directory stored in Jenkins with very few restrictions (build.xml and some Pipeline-related metadata).\r\n\r\nJenkins 2.319 prevents agents from accessing contents of build directories unless itâ€™s for builds currently running on the agent attempting to access the directory.",
