	"identifier": "CVE-2015-4364",
	"description": "Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in includes/campaignmonitor_lists.admin.inc in the Campaign Monitor module 7.x-1.0 for Drupal allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of users for requests that (1) enable list subscriptions via a request to admin/config/services/campaignmonitor/lists/%/enable or (2) disable list subscriptions via a request to admin/config/services/campaignmonitor/lists/%/disable. NOTE: this refers to an issue in an independently developed Drupal module, and NOT an issue in the Campaign Monitor software itself (described on the campaignmonitor.com web site).",
