User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within FormCalc's closeDoc method. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a type confusion condition. An attacker can leverage this to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-5073.",
