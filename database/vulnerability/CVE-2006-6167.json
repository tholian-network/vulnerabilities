	"description": "** DISPUTED **  Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in L. Brandon Stone and Nathanial P. Hendler Active PHP Bookmarks (APB) 1.1.02 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the APB_SETTINGS['apb_path'] parameter in (1) apb_common.php or (2) apb.php.  NOTE: CVE and another third party dispute this vulnerability because these PHP scripts exit if the attack vectors are present in GPC variables.",
