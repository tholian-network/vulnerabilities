	"identifier": "CVE-2023-0888",
	"description": "An improper neutralization of directives in dynamically evaluated code vulnerability in the WiFi Battery embedded web server in versions L90/U70 and L92/U92 can be used to gain administrative access to the WiFi communication module. An authenticated user, having access to both the medical device WiFi network (such as a biomedical engineering staff member) and the specific B.Braun Battery Pack SP with WiFi web server credentials, could get administrative (root) access on the infusion pump communication module. This could be used as a vector to start further attacks",
