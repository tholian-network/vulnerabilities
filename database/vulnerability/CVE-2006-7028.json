	"identifier": "CVE-2006-7028",
	"description": "Single CPU Sun systems running Solaris 7, 8, or 9, such as Netra, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (console hang) via a flood of small TCP/IP packets.  NOTE: this issue has not been replicated by third parties. In addition, the cause is unknown, although it might be related to \"jabber\" and generation of a large amount of interrupts within the console, or a hardware error.",
