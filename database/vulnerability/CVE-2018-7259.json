	"description": "The FSX / P3Dv4 installer 2.0.1.231 for Flight Sim Labs A320-X sends a user's Google account credentials to http://installLog.flightsimlabs.com/LogHandler3.ashx if a pirated serial number has been entered, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information, e.g., by sniffing the network for cleartext HTTP traffic. This behavior was removed in 2.0.1.232.",
