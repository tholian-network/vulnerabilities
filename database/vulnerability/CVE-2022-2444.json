	"identifier": "CVE-2022-2444",
	"description": "The Visualizer: Tables and Charts Manager for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted input via the 'remote_data' parameter in versions up to, and including 3.7.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor privileges and above to call files using a PHAR wrapper that will deserialize the data and call arbitrary PHP Objects that can be used to perform a variety of malicious actions granted a POP chain is also present. It also requires that the attacker is successful in uploading a file with the serialized payload.",
