{
	"identifier": "CVE-2020-4041",
	"description": "In Bolt CMS before version 3.7.1, the filename of uploaded files was vulnerable to stored XSS. It is not possible to inject javascript code in the file name when creating/uploading the file. But, once created/uploaded, it can be renamed to inject the payload in it. Additionally, the measures to prevent renaming the file to disallowed filename extensions could be circumvented. This is fixed in Bolt 3.7.1.",
