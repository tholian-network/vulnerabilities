{
	"identifier": "CVE-2022-24770",
	"description": "'gradio' is an open source framework for building interactive machine learning models and demos. Prior to version 2.8.11, 'gradio' suffers from Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File. The 'gradio' library has a flagging functionality which saves input/output data into a CSV file on the developer's computer. This can allow a user to save arbitrary text into the CSV file, such as commands. If a program like MS Excel opens such a file, then it automatically runs these commands, which could lead to arbitrary commands running on the user's computer. The problem has been patched as of '2.8.11', which escapes the saved csv with single quotes. As a workaround, avoid opening csv files generated by 'gradio' with Excel or similar spreadsheet programs.",
