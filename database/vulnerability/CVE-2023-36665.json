	"identifier": "CVE-2023-36665",
	"description": "protobuf.js (aka protobufjs) 6.10.0 through 7.x before 7.2.4 allows Prototype Pollution, a different vulnerability than CVE-2022-25878. A user-controlled protobuf message can be used by an attacker to pollute the prototype of Object.prototype by adding and overwriting its data and functions. Exploitation can involve: (1) using the function parse to parse protobuf messages on the fly, (2) loading .proto files by using load/loadSync functions, or (3) providing untrusted input to the functions ReflectionObject.setParsedOption and util.setProperty. NOTE: this CVE Record is about \"Object.constructor.prototype.\u003cnew-property\u003e = ...;\" whereas CVE-2022-25878 was about \"Object.__proto__.\u003cnew-property\u003e = ...;\" instead.",
