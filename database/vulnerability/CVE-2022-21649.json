	"identifier": "CVE-2022-21649",
	"description": "Convos is an open source multi-user chat that runs in a web browser. Characters starting with \"https://\" in the chat window create an \u003ca\u003e tag. Stored XSS vulnerability using onfocus and autofocus occurs because escaping exists for \"\u003c\" or \"\u003e\" but escaping for double quotes does not exist. Through this vulnerability, an attacker is capable to execute malicious scripts. Users are advised to update as soon as possible.",
