	"description": "An issue was discovered in Observium Professional, Enterprise \u0026 Community 20.8.10631. It is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to the fact that it is possible to inject malicious SQL statements in malformed parameter types. Sending the improper variable type Array allows a bypass of core SQL Injection sanitization. Users are able to inject malicious statements in multiple functions. This vulnerability leads to full authentication bypass: any unauthorized user with access to the application is able to exploit this vulnerability. This can occur via the Cookie header to the default URI, within includes/authenticate.inc.php.",
