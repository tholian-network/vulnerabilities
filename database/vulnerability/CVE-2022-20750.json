	"identifier": "CVE-2022-20750",
	"description": "A vulnerability in the checkpoint manager implementation of Cisco Redundancy Configuration Manager (RCM) for Cisco StarOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the checkpoint manager process to restart upon receipt of malformed TCP data. This vulnerability is due to improper input validation of an ingress TCP packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TCP data to the affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition due to the checkpoint manager process restarting.",
