	"identifier": "CVE-2022-35956",
	"description": "This Rails gem adds two methods to the ActiveRecord::Base class that allow you to update many records on a single database hit, using a case sql statement for it. Before version 0.1.3 `update_by_case` gem used custom sql strings, and it was not sanitized, making it vulnerable to sql injection. Upgrade to version \u003e= 0.1.3 that uses `Arel` instead to construct the resulting sql statement, with sanitized sql.",
