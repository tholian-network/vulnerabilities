	"identifier": "CVE-2019-14657",
	"description": "Yealink phones through 2019-08-04 have an issue with OpenVPN file upload. They execute tar as root to extract files, but do not validate the extraction directory. Creating a tar file with ../../../../ allows replacement of almost any file on a phone. This leads to password replacement and arbitrary code execution as root.",
