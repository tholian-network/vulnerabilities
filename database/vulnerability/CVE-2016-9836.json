	"identifier": "CVE-2016-9836",
	"description": "The file scanning mechanism of JFilterInput::isFileSafe() in Joomla! CMS before 3.6.5 does not consider alternative PHP file extensions when checking uploaded files for PHP content, which enables a user to upload and execute files with the '.php6', '.php7', '.phtml', and '.phpt' extensions. Additionally, JHelperMedia::canUpload() did not blacklist these file extensions as uploadable file types.",
