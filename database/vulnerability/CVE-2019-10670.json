{
	"identifier": "CVE-2019-10670",
	"description": "An issue was discovered in LibreNMS through 1.47. Many of the scripts rely on the function mysqli_escape_real_string for filtering data. However, this is particularly ineffective when returning user supplied input in an HTML or a JavaScript context, resulting in unsafe data being injected into these contexts, leading to attacker controlled JavaScript executing in the browser. One example of this is the string parameter in html/pages/inventory.inc.php.",
