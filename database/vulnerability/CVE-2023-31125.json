	"identifier": "CVE-2023-31125",
	"description": "Engine.IO is the implementation of transport-based cross-browser/cross-device bi-directional communication layer for Socket.IO. An uncaught exception vulnerability was introduced in version 5.1.0 and included in version 4.1.0 of the 'socket.io' parent package. Older versions are not impacted. A specially crafted HTTP request can trigger an uncaught exception on the Engine.IO server, thus killing the Node.js process. This impacts all the users of the 'engine.io' package, including those who use depending packages like 'socket.io'. This issue was fixed in version 6.4.2 of Engine.IO. There is no known workaround except upgrading to a safe version.",
