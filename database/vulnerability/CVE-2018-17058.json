An authenticated attacker may bypass the frontend filename validation and upload an arbitrary file via FileUploader.aspx.cs in FileUploader.aspx by using empty w and h parameters. This file may contain arbitrary aspx code that may be executed by accessing /Jec/ProductImages/\u003cnumber\u003e/\u003cfilename\u003e. Accessing the file once uploaded does not require authentication.",
