{
	"identifier": "CVE-2021-43974",
	"description": "An issue was discovered in SysAid ITIL 20.4.74 b10. The /enduserreg endpoint is used to register end users anonymously, but does not respect the server-side setting that determines if anonymous users are allowed to register new accounts. Configuring the server-side setting to disable anonymous user registration only hides the client-side registration form. An attacker can still post registration data to create new accounts without prior authentication.",
