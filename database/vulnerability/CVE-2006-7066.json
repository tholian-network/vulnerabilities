	"identifier": "CVE-2006-7066",
	"description": "Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 on Windows XP SP2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) by creating an object inside an iframe, deleting the frame by setting its location.href to about:blank, then accessing a property of the object within the deleted frame, which triggers a NULL pointer dereference.  NOTE: it was later reported that 7.0.6000.16473 and earlier are also affected.",
