	"description": "Microsoft Internet Explorer 7, when prompting for HTTP Basic Authentication for an IDN web site, uses ACE labels for the domain name in the status bar, but uses internationalized labels for this name in the authentication dialog, which might allow remote attackers to perform phishing attacks if the user misinterprets confusable characters in the internationalized labels, as demonstrated by displaying xn--theshmogroup-bgk.com only in the status bar.",
