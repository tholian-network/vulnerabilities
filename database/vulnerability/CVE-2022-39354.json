{
	"identifier": "CVE-2022-39354",
	"description": "SputnikVM, also called evm, is a Rust implementation of Ethereum Virtual Machine. A custom stateful precompile can use the 'is_static' parameter to determine if the call is executed in a static context (via 'STATICCALL'), and thus decide if stateful operations should be done. Prior to version 0.36.0, the passed 'is_static' parameter was incorrect -- it was only set to 'true' if the call came from a direct 'STATICCALL' opcode. However, once a static call context is entered, it should stay static. The issue only impacts custom precompiles that actually uses 'is_static'. For those affected, the issue can lead to possible incorrect state transitions. Version 0.36.0 contains a patch. There are no known workarounds.",
