	"identifier": "CVE-2023-36838",
	"description": "An Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability in the flow processing daemon (flowd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series allows a local, authenticated attacker with low privileges, to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).If a low privileged user executes a specific CLI command, flowd which is responsible for traffic forwarding in SRX crashes and generates a core dump. This will cause temporary traffic interruption until the flowd process is restarted automatically. Continued execution of this command will lead to a sustained DoS.This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series:All versions prior to 20.2R3-S7;20.3 version 20.3R1 and later versions;20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S6;21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S5;21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S4;21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S4;21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-S3;22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3-S1;22.2 versions prior to 22.2R3;22.3 versions prior to 22.3R2;22.4 versions prior to 22.4R1-S1, 22.4R2.",
