	"identifier": "CVE-2001-1517",
	"description": "** DISPUTED ** RunAs (runas.exe) in Windows 2000 stores cleartext authentication information in memory, which could allow attackers to obtain usernames and passwords by executing a process that is allocated the same memory page after termination of a RunAs command.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, saying that administrative privileges are already required to exploit it, and the original researcher did not respond to requests for additional information.",
