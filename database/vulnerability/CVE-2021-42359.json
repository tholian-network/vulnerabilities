{
	"identifier": "CVE-2021-42359",
	"description": "WP DSGVO Tools (GDPR) \u003c= 3.1.23 had an AJAX action, admin-dismiss-unsubscribe, which lacked a capability check and a nonce check and was available to unauthenticated users, and did not check the post type when deleting unsubscription requests. As such, it was possible for an attacker to permanently delete an arbitrary post or page on the site by sending an AJAX request with the action parameter set to admin-dismiss-unsubscribe and the id parameter set to the post to be deleted. Sending such a request would move the post to the trash, and repeating the request would permanently delete the post in question.",
