	"description": "phpGraphy 0.9.11 and earlier allows remote attackers to bypass authentication and gain administrator privileges via a direct request to index.php with the editwelcome parameter set to 1, which can then be used to modify the main page to inject arbitrary HTML and web script.  NOTE: XSS attacks are resultant from this issue, since normal functionality allows the admin to modify pages.",
