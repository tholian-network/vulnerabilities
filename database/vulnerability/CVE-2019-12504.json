{
	"identifier": "CVE-2019-12504",
	"description": "Due to unencrypted and unauthenticated data communication, the wireless presenter Inateck WP2002 is prone to keystroke injection attacks. Thus, an attacker is able to send arbitrary keystrokes to a victim's computer system, e.g., to install malware when the target system is unattended. In this way, an attacker can remotely take control over the victim's computer that is operated with an affected receiver of this device.",
