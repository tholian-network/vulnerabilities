	"identifier": "CVE-2022-24722",
	"description": "VIewComponent is a framework for building view components in Ruby on Rails. Versions prior to 2.31.2 and 2.49.1 contain a cross-site scripting vulnerability that has the potential to impact anyone using translations with the view_component gem. Data received via user input and passed as an interpolation argument to the 'translate' method is not properly sanitized before display. Versions 2.31.2 and 2.49.1 have been released and fully mitigate the vulnerability. As a workaround, avoid passing user input to the 'translate' function, or sanitize the inputs before passing them.",
