{
	"identifier": "CVE-2022-1393",
	"description": "The WP Subtitle WordPress plugin before 3.4.1 adds a subtitle field and provides a shortcode to display it via [wp_subtitle]. The subtitle is stored as a custom post meta with the key: \"wps_subtitle\", which is sanitized upon post save/update, however is not sanitized when updating it directly from the post meta update button (via AJAX) - and this makes the XSS exploitable by authenticated users with a role as low as contributor.",
