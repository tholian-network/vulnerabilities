	"identifier": "CVE-2023-34252",
	"description": "Grav is a file-based Web platform. Prior to version 1.7.42, there is a logic flaw in the 'GravExtension.filterFilter()' function whereby validation against a denylist of unsafe functions is only performed when the argument passed to filter is a string. However, passing an array as a callable argument allows the validation check to be skipped. Consequently, a low privileged attacker with login access to Grav Admin panel and page creation/update permissions is able to inject malicious templates to obtain remote code execution. The vulnerability can be found in the 'GravExtension.filterFilter()' function declared in '/system/src/Grav/Common/Twig/Extension/GravExtension.php'. Version 1.7.42 contains a patch for this issue. End users should also ensure that 'twig.undefined_functions' and 'twig.undefined_filters' properties in '/path/to/webroot/system/config/system.yaml' configuration file are set to 'false' to disallow Twig from treating undefined filters/functions as PHP functions and executing them.",
