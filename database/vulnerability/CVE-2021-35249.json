	"description": "This broken access control vulnerability pertains specifically to a domain admin who can access configuration \u0026 user data of other domains which they should not have access to. Please note the admin is unable to modify the data (read only operation). This UAC issue leads to a data leak to unauthorized users for a domain, with no log of them accessing the data unless they attempt to modify it. This read-only activity is logged to the original domain and does not specify which domain was accessed.",
