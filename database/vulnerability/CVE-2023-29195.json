{
	"identifier": "CVE-2023-29195",
	"description": "Vitess is a database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL through generalized sharding. Prior to version 16.0.2, users can either intentionally or inadvertently create a shard containing '/' characters from VTAdmin such that from that point on, anyone who tries to create a new shard from VTAdmin will receive an error. Attempting to view the keyspace(s) will also no longer work. Creating a shard using 'vtctldclient' does not have the same problem because the CLI validates the input correctly. Version 16.0.2, corresponding to version 0.16.2 of the 'go' module, contains a patch for this issue. Some workarounds are available. Always use 'vtctldclient' to create shards, instead of using VTAdmin; disable creating shards from VTAdmin using RBAC; and/or delete the topology record for the offending shard using the client for your topology server.",
