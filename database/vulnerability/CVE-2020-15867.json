	"identifier": "CVE-2020-15867",
	"description": "The git hook feature in Gogs 0.5.5 through 0.12.2 allows for authenticated remote code execution. There can be a privilege escalation if access to this hook feature is granted to a user who does not have administrative privileges. NOTE: because this is mentioned in the documentation but not in the UI, it could be considered a \"Product UI does not Warn User of Unsafe Actions\" issue.",
