{
	"identifier": "CVE-2023-30628",
	"description": "Kiwi TCMS is an open source test management system. In kiwitcms/Kiwi v12.2 and prior and kiwitcms/enterprise v12.2 and prior,the 'changelog.yml' workflow is vulnerable to command injection attacks because of using an untrusted 'github.head_ref' field. The 'github.head_ref' value is an attacker-controlled value. Assigning the value to 'zzz\";echo${IFS}\"hello\";#' can lead to command injection. Since the permission is not restricted, the attacker has a write-access to the repository. Commit 834c86dfd1b2492ccad7ebbfd6304bfec895fed2 of the kiwitcms/Kiwi repository and commit e39f7e156fdaf6fec09a15ea6f4e8fec8cdbf751 of the kiwitcms/enterprise repository contain a fix for this issue.",
