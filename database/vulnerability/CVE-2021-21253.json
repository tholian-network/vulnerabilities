{
	"identifier": "CVE-2021-21253",
	"description": "OnlineVotingSystem is an open source project hosted on GitHub. OnlineVotingSystem before version 1.1.2 hashes user passwords without a salt, which is vulnerable to dictionary attacks. Therefore there is a threat of security breach in the voting system. Without a salt, it is much easier for attackers to pre-compute the hash value using dictionary attack techniques such as rainbow tables to crack passwords. This problem is fixed and published in version 1.1.2. A long randomly generated salt is added to the password hash function to better protect passwords stored in the voting system.",
