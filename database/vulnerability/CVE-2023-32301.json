Prior to version 3.0.4 of the 'stable' branch and version 3.1.0.beta5 of the 'beta' and 'tests-passed' branches, multiple duplicate topics could be created if topic embedding is enabled. This issue is patched in version 3.0.4 of the 'stable' branch and version 3.1.0.beta5 of the 'beta' and 'tests-passed' branches. As a workaround, disable topic embedding if it has been enabled.",
