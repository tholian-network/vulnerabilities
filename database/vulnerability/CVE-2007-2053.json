	"identifier": "CVE-2007-2053",
	"description": "Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in AFFLIB before 2.2.6 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via (1) a long LastModified value in an S3 XML response in lib/s3.cpp; (2) a long (a) path or (b) bucket in an S3 URL in lib/vnode_s3.cpp; or (3) a long (c) EFW, (d) AFD, or (c) aimage file path.  NOTE: the aimage vector (3c) has since been recalled from the researcher's original advisory, since the code is not called in any version of AFFLIB.",
