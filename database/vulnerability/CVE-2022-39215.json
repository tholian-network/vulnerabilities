{
	"identifier": "CVE-2022-39215",
	"description": "Tauri is a framework for building binaries for all major desktop platforms. Due to missing canonicalization when `readDir` is called recursively, it was possible to display directory listings outside of the defined `fs` scope. This required a crafted symbolic link or junction folder inside an allowed path of the `fs` scope. No arbitrary file content could be leaked. The issue has been resolved in version 1.0.6 and the implementation now properly checks if the requested (sub) directory is a symbolic link outside of the defined `scope`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable the `readDir` endpoint in the `allowlist` inside the `tauri.conf.json`.",
