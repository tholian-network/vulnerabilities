	"description": "An issue was discovered in Nim before 1.6.2. The RST module of the Nim language stdlib, as used in NimForum and other products, permits the javascript: URI scheme and thus can lead to XSS in some applications. (Nim versions 1.6.2 and later are fixed; there may be backports of the fix to some earlier versions. NimForum 2.2.0 is fixed.)",
