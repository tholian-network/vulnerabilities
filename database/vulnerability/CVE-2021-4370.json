	"description": "The uListing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass as most actions and endpoints are accessible to unauthenticated users, lack security nonces, and data is seldom validated. This issue exists in versions up to, and including, 1.6.6. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to conduct numerous administrative actions, including those less critical than the explicitly outlined ones in our detection.",
