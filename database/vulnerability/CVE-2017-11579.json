{
	"identifier": "CVE-2017-11579",
	"description": "In the most recent firmware for Blipcare, the device provides an open Wireless network called \"Blip\" for communicating with the device. The user connects to this open Wireless network and uses the web management interface of the device to provide the user's Wi-Fi credentials so that the device can connect to it and have Internet access. This device acts as a Wireless Blood pressure monitor and is used to measure blood pressure levels of a person. This allows an attacker who is in vicinity of Wireless signal generated by the Blipcare device to easily sniff the credentials. Also, an attacker can connect to the open wireless network \"Blip\" exposed by the device and modify the HTTP response presented to the user by the device to execute other attacks such as convincing the user to download and execute a malicious binary that would infect a user's computer or mobile device with malware.",
