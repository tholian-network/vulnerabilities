	"description": "Apple iTunes 7.0.2 allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted XML list of radio stations, which results in memory corruption.  NOTE: iTunes retrieves the XML document from a static URL, which requires an attacker to perform DNS spoofing or man-in-the-middle attacks for exploitation.",
