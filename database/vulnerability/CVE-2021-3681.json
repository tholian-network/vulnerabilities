	"identifier": "CVE-2021-3681",
	"description": "A security issue was found in Ansible Galaxy Collections. When collections are built manually, any files in the repository directory that are not explicitly excluded via the build_ignore list in galaxy.yml include files in the .tar.gz file. This contains sensitive info, such as the user's Ansible Galaxy API key and any secrets in ansible or ansible-playbook verbose output without the no_log redaction. Currently, there is no way to deprecate a Collection Or delete a Collection Version. Once published, anyone who downloads or installs the collection can view the secrets.",
