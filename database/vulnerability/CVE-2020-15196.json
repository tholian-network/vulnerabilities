{
	"identifier": "CVE-2020-15196",
	"description": "In Tensorflow version 2.3.0, the 'SparseCountSparseOutput' and 'RaggedCountSparseOutput' implementations don't validate that the 'weights' tensor has the same shape as the data. The check exists for 'DenseCountSparseOutput', where both tensors are fully specified. In the sparse and ragged count weights are still accessed in parallel with the data. But, since there is no validation, a user passing fewer weights than the values for the tensors can generate a read from outside the bounds of the heap buffer allocated for the weights. The issue is patched in commit 3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02 and is released in TensorFlow version 2.3.1.",
