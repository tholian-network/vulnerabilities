{
	"identifier": "CVE-2020-15193",
	"description": "In Tensorflow before versions 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, the implementation of 'dlpack.to_dlpack' can be made to use uninitialized memory resulting in further memory corruption. This is because the pybind11 glue code assumes that the argument is a tensor. However, there is nothing stopping users from passing in a Python object instead of a tensor. The uninitialized memory address is due to a 'reinterpret_cast' Since the 'PyObject' is a Python object, not a TensorFlow Tensor, the cast to 'EagerTensor' fails. The issue is patched in commit 22e07fb204386768e5bcbea563641ea11f96ceb8 and is released in TensorFlow versions 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.",
