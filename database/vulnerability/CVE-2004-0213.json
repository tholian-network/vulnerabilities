	"description": "Utility Manager in Windows 2000 launches winhlp32.exe while Utility Manager is running with raised privileges, which allows local users to gain system privileges via a \"Shatter\" style attack that sends a Windows message to cause Utility Manager to launch winhlp32 by directly accessing the context sensitive help and bypassing the GUI, then sending another message to winhlp32 in order to open a user-selected file, a different vulnerability than CVE-2003-0908.",
