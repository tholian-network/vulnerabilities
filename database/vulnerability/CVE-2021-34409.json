{
	"identifier": "CVE-2021-34409",
	"description": "It was discovered that the installation packages of the Zoom Client for Meetings for MacOS (Standard and for IT Admin) installation before version 5.2.0, Zoom Client Plugin for Sharing iPhone/iPad before version 5.2.0, and Zoom Rooms for Conference before version 5.1.0, copy pre- and post- installation shell scripts to a user-writable directory. In the affected products listed below, a malicious actor with local access to a user's machine could use this flaw to potentially run arbitrary system commands in a higher privileged context during the installation process.",
