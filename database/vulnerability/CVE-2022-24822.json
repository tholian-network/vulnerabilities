	"description": "Podium is a library for building micro frontends. @podium/layout is a module for building a Podium layout server, and @podium/proxy is a module for proxying HTTP requests from a layout server to a podlet server. In @podium/layout prior to version 4.6.110 and @podium/proxy prior to version 4.2.74, an attacker using the 'Trailer' header as part of the request against proxy endpoints has the ability to take down the server. All Podium layouts that include podlets with proxy endpoints are affected. '@podium/layout', which is the main way developers/users are vulnerable to this exploit, has been patched in version '4.6.110'. All earlier versions are vulnerable.'@podium/proxy', which is the source of the vulnerability and is used by '@podium/layout' has been patched in version '4.2.74'. All earlier versions are vulnerable. It is not easily possible to work around this issue without upgrading.",
