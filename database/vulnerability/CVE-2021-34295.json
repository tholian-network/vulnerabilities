	"description": "A vulnerability has been identified in JT2Go (All versions \u003c V13.2), Teamcenter Visualization (All versions \u003c V13.2). The Gif_loader.dll library in affected applications lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing GIF files. This could result in an out of bounds write past the end of an allocated structure. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.
