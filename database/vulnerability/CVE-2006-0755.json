	"identifier": "CVE-2006-0755",
	"description": "** DISPUTED ** Multiple PHP remote file include vulnerabilities in dotProject 2.0.1 and earlier, when register_globals is enabled, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via the baseDir parameter in (1) db_adodb.php, (2) db_connect.php, (3) session.php, (4) vw_usr_roles.php, (5) calendar.php, (6) date_format.php, and (7) tasks/gantt.php; and the dPconfig[root_dir] parameter in (8) projects/gantt.php, (9) gantt2.php, and (10) vw_files.php.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, stating that the product documentation clearly recommends that the system administrator disable register_globals, and that the check.php script warns against this setting.  Also, the vendor says that the protection.php/siteurl vector is incorrect because protection.php does not exist in the product.",
