	"identifier": "CVE-2005-4203",
	"description": "LogiSphere 0.9.9j does not restrict the number of messages that can be sent, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service by sending a large number of messages via the msg command.  NOTE: due to lack of appropriate details by the original researcher, it is unclear whether this description accurately reflects the discloser's claim and is distinct from the XSS issue.",
