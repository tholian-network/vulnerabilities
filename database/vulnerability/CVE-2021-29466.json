In versions of Discord-Recon 0.0.3 and prior, a remote attacker is able to read local files from the server that can disclose important information. As a workaround, a bot maintainer can locate the file 'app.py' and add '.replace('..', '')' into the 'Path' variable inside of the 'recon' function. The vulnerability is patched in version 0.0.4.",
