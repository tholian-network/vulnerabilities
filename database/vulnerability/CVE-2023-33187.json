	"identifier": "CVE-2023-33187",
	"description": "Highlight is an open source, full-stack monitoring platform. Highlight may record passwords on customer deployments when a password html input is switched to 'type=\"text\"' via a javascript \"Show Password\" button. This differs from the expected behavior which always obfuscates 'type=\"password\"' inputs. A customer may assume that switching to 'type=\"text\"' would also not record this input; hence, they would not add additional 'highlight-mask' css-class obfuscation to this part of the DOM, resulting in unintentional recording of a password value when a 'Show Password' button is used. This issue was patched in version 6.0.0.This patch tracks changes to the 'type' attribute of an input to ensure an input that used to be a 'type=\"password\"' continues to be obfuscated.",
