	"identifier": "CVE-2023-36819",
	"description": "Knowage is the professional open source suite for modern business analytics over traditional sources and big data systems. The endpoint '_/knowage/restful-services/dossier/importTemplateFile_' allows authenticated users to download template hosted on the server. However, starting in the 6.x.x branch and prior to version 8.1.8, the application does not sanitize the '_templateName_ 'parameter allowing an attacker to use '*../*' in it, and escaping the directory the template are normally placed and download any file from the system. This vulnerability allows a low privileged attacker to exfiltrate sensitive configuration file. This issue has been patched in Knowage version 8.1.8.",
