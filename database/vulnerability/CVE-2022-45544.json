	"description": "** DISPUTED ** Insecure Permission vulnerability in Schlix Web Inc SCHLIX CMS 2.2.7-2 allows attacker to upload arbitrary files and execute arbitrary code via the tristao parameter. NOTE: this is disputed by the vendor because an admin is intentionally allowed to upload new executable PHP code, such as a theme that was obtained from a trusted source or was developed for their own website. Only an admin can upload such code, not someone else in an \"attacker\" role.",
