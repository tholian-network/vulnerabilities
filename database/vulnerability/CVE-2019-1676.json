	"description": "A vulnerability in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) call processing of Cisco Meeting Server (CMS) software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition of the Cisco Meeting Server. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of Session Description Protocol (SDP) messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SDP message to the CMS call bridge. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the CMS to reload, causing a DoS condition for all connected clients. Versions prior to 2.3.9 are affected.",
