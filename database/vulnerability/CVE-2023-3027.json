	"description": "The grc-policy-propagator allows security escalation within the cluster. The propagator allows policies which contain some dynamically obtained values (instead of the policy apply a static manifest on a managed cluster) of taking advantage of cluster scoped access in a created policy. This feature does not restrict properly to lookup content from the namespace where the policy was created.",
