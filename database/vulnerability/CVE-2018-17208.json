{
	"identifier": "CVE-2018-17208",
	"description": "Linksys Velop 1.1.2.187020 devices allow unauthenticated command injection, providing an attacker with full root access, via cgi-bin/zbtest.cgi or cgi-bin/zbtest2.cgi (scripts that can be discovered with binwalk on the firmware, but are not visible in the web interface). This occurs because shell metacharacters in the query string are mishandled by ShellExecute, as demonstrated by the zbtest.cgi?cmd=level\u0026level= substring. This can also be exploited via CSRF.",
