	"identifier": "CVE-2021-1450",
	"description": "A vulnerability in the interprocess communication (IPC) channel of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client could allow an authenticated, local attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials on the device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending one or more crafted IPC messages to the AnyConnect process on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to stop the AnyConnect process, causing a DoS condition on the device. Note: The process under attack will automatically restart so no action is needed by the user or admin.",
