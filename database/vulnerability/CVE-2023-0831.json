This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the dismiss_notice function called via the admin_action_ucp_dismiss_notice action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to dismiss plugin notifications via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
