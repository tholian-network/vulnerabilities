	"description": "In AppSpider installer versions prior to 7.2.126, the AppSpider installer calls an executable which can be placed in the appropriate directory by an attacker with access to the local machine. This would prevent the installer from distinguishing between a valid executable called during an installation and any arbitrary code executable using the same file name.",
