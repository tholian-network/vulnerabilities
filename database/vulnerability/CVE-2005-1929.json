{
	"identifier": "CVE-2005-1929",
	"description": "Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in (1) isaNVWRequest.dll and (2) relay.dll in Trend Micro ServerProtect Management Console 5.58 and earlier, as used in Control Manager 2.5 and 3.0 and Damage Cleanup Server 1.1, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via \"wrapped\" length values in Chunked transfer requests.  NOTE: the original report suggests that the relay.dll issue is related to a problem in which a Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) static library returns invalid values under heavy load.  As such, this might not be a vulnerability in Trend Micro's product.",
