	"description": "Directory traversal vulnerability in autoinstall4imagesgalleryupgrade.php in the Fantastico De Luxe Module for cPanel allows remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via directory traversal sequences in the scriptpath_show parameter in a GoAhead action.  NOTE: this issue only crosses privilege boundaries when security settings such as disable_functions and safe_mode are active, since exploitation requires uploading of executable code to a home directory.",
