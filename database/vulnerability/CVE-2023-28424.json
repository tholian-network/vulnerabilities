{
	"identifier": "CVE-2023-28424",
	"description": "Soko if the code that powers packages.gentoo.org. Prior to version 1.0.2, the two package search handlers, `Search` and `SearchFeed`, implemented in `pkg/app/handler/packages/search.go`, are affected by a SQL injection via the `q` parameter. As a result, unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries on `https://packages.gentoo.org/`. It was also demonstrated that primitive was enough to gain code execution in the context of the PostgreSQL container. The issue was addressed in commit `4fa6e4b619c0362728955b6ec56eab0e0cbf1e23y` of version 1.0.2 using prepared statements to interpolate user-controlled data in SQL queries.",
