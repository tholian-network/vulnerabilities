	"description": "** DISPUTED ** In Solstice Pod before 3.0.3, the firmware can easily be decompiled/disassembled. The decompiled/disassembled files contain non-obfuscated code. NOTE: it is unclear whether lack of obfuscation is directly associated with a negative impact, or instead only facilitates an attack technique.",
