	"identifier": "CVE-2008-6975",
	"description": "Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in apply.cgi in DD-WRT 24 sp2 allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that (1) execute arbitrary commands via the ping_ip parameter; (2) change the administrative credentials via the http_username and http_passwd parameters; (3) enable remote administration via the remote_management parameter; or (4) configure port forwarding via certain from, to, ip, and pro parameters.  NOTE: This issue reportedly exists because of a \"weak ... anti-CSRF fix\" implemented in 24 sp2.",
