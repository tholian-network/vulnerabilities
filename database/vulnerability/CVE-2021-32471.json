{
	"identifier": "CVE-2021-32471",
	"description": "Insufficient input validation in the Marvin Minsky 1967 implementation of the Universal Turing Machine allows program users to execute arbitrary code via crafted data. For example, a tape head may have an unexpected location after the processing of input composed of As and Bs (instead of 0s and 1s). NOTE: the discoverer states \"this vulnerability has no real-world implications.\"",
