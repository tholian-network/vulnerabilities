{
	"identifier": "CVE-2017-6617",
	"description": "A vulnerability in the session identification management functionality of the web-based GUI of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) 3.0(1c) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to hijack a valid user session on an affected system. The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not assign a new session identifier to a user session when a user authenticates to the web-based GUI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a hijacked session identifier to connect to the software through the web-based GUI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to hijack an authenticated user's browser session on the affected system. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd14583.",
