{
	"identifier": "CVE-2018-8711",
	"description": "A local file inclusion issue was discovered in the WooCommerce Products Filter (aka WOOF) plugin before 2.2.0 for WordPress, as demonstrated by the shortcode parameter in a woof_redraw_woof action. The vulnerability is due to the lack of args/input validation on render_html before allowing it to be called by extract(), a PHP built-in function. Because of this, the supplied args/input can be used to overwrite the $pagepath variable, which then could lead to a local file inclusion attack.",
