	"identifier": "CVE-2017-2829",
	"description": "An exploitable directory traversal vulnerability exists in the web management interface used by the Foscam C1 Indoor HD Camera running application firmware 2.52.2.37. A specially crafted HTTP request can cause the application to read a file from disk but a failure to adequately filter characters results in allowing an attacker to specify a file outside of a directory. An attacker can simply send an HTTP request to the device to trigger this vulnerability.",
