	"description": "Kanboard is open source project management software that focuses on the Kanban methodology. A stored Cross site scripting (XSS) allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Javascript and any user who views the task containing the malicious code will be exposed to the XSS attack.

Users unable to upgrade should ensure that they have a restrictive CSP header config.",
