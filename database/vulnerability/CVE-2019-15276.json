	"identifier": "CVE-2019-15276",
	"description": "A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Software could allow a low-privileged, authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability exists due to a failure of the HTTP parsing engine to handle specially crafted URLs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating with low privileges to an affected controller and submitting the crafted URL to the web interface of the affected device. Conversely, an unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the web interface to click the crafted URL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected restart of the device, resulting in a DoS condition.",
