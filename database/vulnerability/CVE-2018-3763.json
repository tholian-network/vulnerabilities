	"description": "In Nextcloud Calendar before 1.5.8 and 1.6.1, a missing sanitization of search results for an autocomplete field could lead to a stored XSS requiring user-interaction. The missing sanitization only affected group names, hence malicious search results could only be crafted by privileged users like admins or group admins.",
