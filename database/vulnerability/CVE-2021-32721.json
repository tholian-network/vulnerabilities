	"identifier": "CVE-2021-32721",
	"description": "PowerMux is a drop-in replacement for Go's http.ServeMux. In PowerMux versions prior to 1.1.1, attackers may be able to craft phishing links and other open redirects by exploiting the trailing slash redirection feature. This may lead to users being redirected to untrusted sites after following an attacker crafted link. The issue is resolved in v1.1.1. There are no existing workarounds.",
