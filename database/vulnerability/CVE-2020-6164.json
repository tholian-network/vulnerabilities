{
	"identifier": "CVE-2020-6164",
	"description": "In SilverStripe through 4.5.0, a specific URL path configured by default through the silverstripe/framework module can be used to disclose the fact that a domain is hosting a Silverstripe application. There is no disclosure of the specific version. The functionality on this URL path is limited to execution in a CLI context, and is not known to present a vulnerability through web-based access. As a side-effect, this preconfigured path also blocks the creation of other resources on this path (e.g. a page).",
