{
	"identifier": "CVE-2021-41263",
	"description": "rails_multisite provides multi-db support for Rails applications. In affected versions this vulnerability impacts any Rails applications using 'rails_multisite' alongside Rails' signed/encrypted cookies. Depending on how the application makes use of these cookies, it may be possible for an attacker to re-use cookies on different 'sites' within a multi-site Rails application. The issue has been patched in v4 of the 'rails_multisite' gem. Note that this upgrade will invalidate all previous signed/encrypted cookies. The impact of this invalidation will vary based on the application architecture.",
