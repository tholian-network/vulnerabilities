{
	"identifier": "CVE-2023-37473",
	"description": "zenstruck/collections is a set of helpers for iterating/paginating/filtering collections. Passing _callable strings_ (ie 'system') caused the function to be executed. This would result in a limited subset of specific user input being executed as if it were code. This issue has been addressed in commit 'f4b1c48820' and included in release version 0.2.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that user input is not passed to either 'EntityRepository::find()' or 'query()'.",
