{
	"identifier": "CVE-2022-48222",
	"description": "An issue was discovered in Acuant AcuFill SDK before 10.22.02.03. During SDK installation, certutil.exe is called by the Acuant installer to install certificates. This window is not hidden, and is running with elevated privileges. A standard user can break out of this window, obtaining a full SYSTEM command prompt window. This results in complete compromise via arbitrary SYSTEM code execution (elevation of privileges).",
