	"description": "F-Secure Anti-Virus for Windows Servers 7.0 64-bit edition allows local users to bypass virus scanning by using the system32 directory to store a crafted (1) archive or (2) packed executable.  NOTE: in many environments, this does not cross privilege boundaries because any process able to write to system32 could also shut off F-Secure Anti-Virus.",
