	"identifier": "CVE-2020-12255",
	"description": "rConfig 3.9.4 is vulnerable to remote code execution due to improper validation in the file upload functionality. vendor.crud.php accepts a file upload by checking content-type without considering the file extension and header. Thus, an attacker can exploit this by uploading a .php file to vendor.php that contains arbitrary PHP code and changing the content-type to image/gif.",
