	"identifier": "CVE-2023-29011",
	"description": "Git for Windows, the Windows port of Git, ships with an executable called 'connect.exe', which implements a SOCKS5 proxy that can be used to connect e.g. to SSH servers via proxies when certain ports are blocked for outgoing connections. The location of 'connect.exe''s config file is hard-coded as '/etc/connectrc' which will typically be interpreted as 'C:\\etc\\connectrc'. Since 'C:\\etc' can be created by any authenticated user, this makes 'connect.exe' susceptible to malicious files being placed there by other users on the same multi-user machine. The problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.40.1. As a workaround, create the folder 'etc' on all drives where Git commands are run, and remove read/write access from those folders. Alternatively, watch out for malicious '\u003cdrive\u003e:\\etc\\connectrc' files on multi-user machines.",
