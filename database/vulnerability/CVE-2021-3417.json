	"description": "An internal product security audit of LXCO, prior to version 1.2.2, discovered that credentials for Lenovo XClarity Administrator (LXCA), if added as a Resource Manager, are encoded then written to an internal LXCO log file each time a session is established with LXCA. Affected logs are captured in the First Failure Data Capture (FFDC) service log. The FFDC service log is only generated when requested by a privileged LXCO user and it is only accessible to the privileged LXCO user that requested the file.",
