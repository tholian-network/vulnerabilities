	"identifier": "CVE-2018-12446",
	"description": "** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the com.dropbox.android application 98.2.2 for Android. The Passcode feature allows authentication bypass via runtime manipulation that forces a certain method's return value to true. In other words, an attacker could authenticate with an arbitrary passcode. NOTE: the vendor indicates that this is not an attack of interest within the context of their threat model, which excludes Android devices on which rooting has occurred.",
