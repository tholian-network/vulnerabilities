{
	"identifier": "CVE-2020-17392",
	"description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Parallels Desktop 15.1.3-47255. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handler for HOST_IOCTL_SET_KERNEL_SYMBOLS in the prl_hypervisor kext. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied value prior to dereferencing it as a pointer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the kernel. Was ZDI-CAN-10519.",
