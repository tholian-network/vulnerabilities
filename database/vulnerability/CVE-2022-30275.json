{
	"identifier": "CVE-2022-30275",
	"description": "The Motorola MOSCAD Toolbox software through 2022-05-02 relies on a cleartext password. It utilizes an MDLC driver to communicate with MOSCAD/ACE RTUs for engineering purposes. Access to these communications is protected by a password stored in cleartext in the wmdlcdrv.ini driver configuration file. In addition, this password is used for access control to MOSCAD/STS projects protected with the Legacy Password feature. In this case, an insecure CRC of the password is present in the project file: this CRC is validated against the password in the driver configuration file.",
