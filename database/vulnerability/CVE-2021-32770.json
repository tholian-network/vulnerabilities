{
	"identifier": "CVE-2021-32770",
	"description": "Gatsby is a framework for building websites. The gatsby-source-wordpress plugin prior to versions 4.0.8 and 5.9.2 leaks .htaccess HTTP Basic Authentication variables into the app.js bundle during build-time. Users who are not initializing basic authentication credentials in the gatsby-config.js are not affected. A patch has been introduced in gatsby-source-wordpress@4.0.8 and gatsby-source-wordpress@5.9.2 which mitigates the issue by filtering all variables specified in the 'auth: { }' section. Users that depend on this functionality are advised to upgrade to the latest release of gatsby-source-wordpress, run 'gatsby clean' followed by a 'gatsby build'. One may manually edit the app.js file post-build as a workaround.",
