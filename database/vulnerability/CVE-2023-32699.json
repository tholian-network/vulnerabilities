{
	"identifier": "CVE-2023-32699",
	"description": "MeterSphere is an open source continuous testing platform. Version 2.9.1 and prior are vulnerable to denial of service. The 'checkUserPassword' method is used to check whether the password provided by the user matches the password saved in the database, and the 'CodingUtil.md5' method is used to encrypt the original password with MD5 to ensure that the password will not be saved in plain text when it is stored. If a user submits a very long password when logging in, the system will be forced to execute the long password MD5 encryption process, causing the server CPU and memory to be exhausted, thereby causing a denial of service attack on the server. This issue is fixed in version 2.10.0-lts with a maximum password length.",
