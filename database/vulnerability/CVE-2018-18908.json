	"identifier": "CVE-2018-18908",
	"description": "The Sky Go Desktop application 1.0.19-1 through 1.0.23-1 for Windows performs several requests over cleartext HTTP. This makes the data submitted in these requests prone to Man in The Middle (MiTM) attacks, whereby an attacker would be able to obtain the data sent in these requests. Some of the requests contain potentially sensitive information that could be useful to an attacker, such as the victim's Sky username.",
