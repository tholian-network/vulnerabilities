	"identifier": "CVE-2017-15871",
	"description": "** DISPUTED ** The deserialize function in serialize-to-js through 1.1.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service via vectors involving an Immediately Invoked Function Expression \"function()\" substring, as demonstrated by a \"function(){console.log(\" call or a simple infinite loop. NOTE: the vendor agrees that denial of service can occur but notes that deserialize is explicitly listed as \"harmful\" within the README.md file.",
