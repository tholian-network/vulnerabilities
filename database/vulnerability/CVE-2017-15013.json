	"identifier": "CVE-2017-15013",
	"description": "OpenText Documentum Content Server (formerly EMC Documentum Content Server) through 7.3 contains the following design gap, which allows an authenticated user to gain superuser privileges: Content Server stores information about uploaded files in dmr_content objects, which are queryable and \"editable\" (before release 7.2P02, any authenticated user was able to edit dmr_content objects; now any authenticated user may delete a dmr_content object and then create a new one with the old identifier) by authenticated users; this allows any authenticated user to replace the content of security-sensitive dmr_content objects (for example, dmr_content related to dm_method objects) and gain superuser privileges.",
