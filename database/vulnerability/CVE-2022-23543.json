{
	"identifier": "CVE-2022-23543",
	"description": "Silverware Games is a social network where people can play games online. Users can attach URLs to YouTube videos, the site will generate related '\u003ciframe\u003e' when the post will be published. The handler has some sort of protection so non-YouTube links can't be posted, as well as HTML tags are being stripped. However, it was still possible to add custom HTML attributes (e.g. 'onclick=alert(\"xss\")') to the '\u003ciframe\u003e'. This issue was fixed in the version '1.1.34' and does not require any extra actions from our members. There has been no evidence that this vulnerability was used by anyone at this time.",
