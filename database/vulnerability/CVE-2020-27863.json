Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the dhttpd service, which listens on TCP port 8008 by default. The issue results from incorrect string matching logic when accessing protected pages. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose stored credentials, leading to further compromise.
