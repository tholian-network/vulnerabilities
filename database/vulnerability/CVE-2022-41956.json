	"identifier": "CVE-2022-41956",
	"description": "Autolab is a course management service, initially developed by a team of students at Carnegie Mellon University, that enables instructors to offer autograded programming assignments to their students over the Web. A file disclosure vulnerability was discovered in Autolab's remote handin feature, whereby users are able to hand-in assignments using paths outside their submission directory. Users can then view the submission to view the file's contents. The vulnerability has been patched in version 2.10.0. As a workaround, ensure that the field for the remote handin feature is empty (Edit Assessment \u003e Advanced \u003e Remote handin path), and that you are not running Autolab as 'root' (or any user that has write access to '/'). Alternatively, disable the remote handin feature if it is unneeded by replacing the body of 'local_submit' in 'app/controllers/assessment/handin.rb' with 'render(plain: \"Feature disabled\", status: :bad_request) \u0026\u0026 return'.",
