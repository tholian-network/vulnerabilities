	"identifier": "CVE-2023-30857",
	"description": "@aedart/support is the support package for Ion, a monorepo for JavaScript/TypeScript packages. Prior to version '0.6.1', there is a possible prototype pollution issue for the 'MetadataRecord', when merged with a base class' metadata object, in 'meta' decorator from the '@aedart/support' package. The likelihood of exploitation is questionable, given that a class's metadata can only be set or altered when the class is decorated via 'meta()'. Furthermore, object(s) of sensitive nature would have to be stored as metadata, before this can lead to a security impact. The issue has been patched in version '0.6.1'.",
