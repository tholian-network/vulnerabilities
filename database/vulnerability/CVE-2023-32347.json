{
	"identifier": "CVE-2023-32347",
	"description": "Teltonikas Remote Management System versions prior to 4.10.0 use device serial numbers and MAC addresses to identify devices from the user perspective for device claiming and from the device perspective for authentication. If an attacker obtained the serial number and MAC address of a device, they could authenticate as that device and steal communication credentials of the device. This could allow an attacker to enable arbitrary command execution as root by utilizing management options within the newly registered devices.",
