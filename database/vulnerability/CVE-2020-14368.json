{
	"identifier": "CVE-2020-14368",
	"description": "A flaw was found in Eclipse Che in versions prior to 7.14.0 that impacts CodeReady Workspaces. When configured with cookies authentication, Theia IDE doesn't properly set the SameSite value, allowing a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and consequently allowing a cross-site WebSocket hijack on Theia IDE. This flaw allows an attacker to gain full access to the victim's workspace through the /services endpoint. To perform a successful attack, the attacker conducts a Man-in-the-middle attack (MITM) and tricks the victim into executing a request via an untrusted link, which performs the CSRF and the Socket hijack. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.",
