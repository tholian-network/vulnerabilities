{
	"id": "CVE-2022-23594",
	"description": "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The TFG dialect of TensorFlow (MLIR) makes several assumptions about the incoming `GraphDef` before converting it to the MLIR-based dialect. If an attacker changes the `SavedModel` format on disk to invalidate these assumptions and the `GraphDef` is then converted to MLIR-based IR then they can cause a crash in the Python interpreter. Under certain scenarios, heap OOB read/writes are possible. These issues have been discovered via fuzzing and it is possible that more weaknesses exist. We will patch them as they are discovered.\n\nAffected: tensorflow tensorflow >= 2.7.0, < 2.8.0\n\nAffected: tensorflow tensorflow >= 2.7.0, < 2.8.0",
