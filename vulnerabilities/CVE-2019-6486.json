{
	"id": "CVE-2019-6486",
	"description": "Go before 1.10.8 and 1.11.x before 1.11.5 mishandles P-521 and P-384 elliptic curves, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) or possibly conduct ECDH private key recovery attacks.\n\nGo before versions 1.10.8 and 1.11.5 has a vulnerability in the crypto/elliptic implementations of the P-521 and P-384 elliptic curves. A remote attacker can exploit this by crafting inputs that consume excessive amounts of CPU. These inputs might be delivered via TLS handshakes, X.509 certificates, JWT tokens, ECDH shares or ECDSA signatures. In some cases, if an ECDH private key is reused more than once, the attack can also lead to key recovery.",
