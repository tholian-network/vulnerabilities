	"id": "CVE-2020-17398",
	"description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose information on affected installations of Parallels Desktop 15.1.4. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the prl_hypervisor kext. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel. Was ZDI-CAN-11302.\n\nAffected: Parallels Desktop 15.1.4\n\nAffected: Parallels Desktop 15.1.4",
