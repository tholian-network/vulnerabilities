	"description": "Squid through 4.14 and 5.x through 5.0.5, in some configurations, allows information disclosure because of an out-of-bounds read in WCCP protocol data. This can be leveraged as part of a chain for remote code execution as nobody.\n\nSquid before version 5.2, in some configurations, allows information disclosure because of an out-of-bounds read in WCCPv2 protocol data. This problem allows a WCCPv2 sender to corrupt Squids list of known WCCP routers and divert client traffic to attacker controlled routers.",
