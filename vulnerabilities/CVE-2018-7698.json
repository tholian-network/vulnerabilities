	"description": "An issue was discovered in D-Link mydlink+ 3.8.5 build 259 for DCS-933L 1.05.04 and DCS-934L 1.05.04 devices. The mydlink+ app sends the username and password for connected D-Link cameras (such as DCS-933L and DCS-934L) unencrypted from the app to the camera, allowing attackers to obtain these credentials and gain control of the camera including the ability to view the camera's stream and make changes without the user's knowledge.",
