	"description": "Nextcloud server before 19.0.11, 20.0.10, 21.0.2 is vulnerable to brute force attacks due to lack of inclusion of IPv6 subnets in rate-limiting considerations. This could potentially result in an attacker bypassing rate-limit controls such as the Nextcloud brute-force protection.\n\nAffected: n/a Nextcloud Server Fixed in 19.0.11, 20.0.10, 21.0.2\n\nNextcloud server before version 21.0.2 did not consider IPv6 subnets in the ratelimiting implementation. This could potentially result in an attacker bypassing ratelimit controls such as the Nextcloud bruteforce protection.",
