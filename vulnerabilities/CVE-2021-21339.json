	"description": "TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. In TYPO3 before versions 6.2.57, 7.6.51, 8.7.40, 9.5.25, 10.4.14, 11.1.1 user session identifiers were stored in cleartext - without processing of additional cryptographic hashing algorithms. This vulnerability cannot be exploited directly and occurs in combination with a chained attack - like for instance SQL injection in any other component of the system. This is fixed in versions 6.2.57, 7.6.51, 8.7.40, 9.5.25, 10.4.14, 11.1.1.\n\nAffected: TYPO3 TYPO3.CMS >= 6.2.0, <= 6.2.56, >= 7.0.0, <= 7.6.50, >= 8.0.0, <= 8.7.39, >= 9.0.0, <= 9.5.24, >= 10.0.0, <= 10.4.13, >= 11.0.0, <= 11.1.0",
