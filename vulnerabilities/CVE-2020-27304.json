	"id": "CVE-2020-27304",
	"description": "The CivetWeb web library does not validate uploaded filepaths when running on an OS other than Windows, when using the built-in HTTP form-based file upload mechanism, via the mg_handle_form_request API. Web applications that use the file upload form handler, and use parts of the user-controlled filename in the output path, are susceptible to directory traversal",
