	"description": "Nextcloud Server is a Nextcloud package that handles data storage. A vulnerability in federated share exists in versions prior to 19.0.11, 20.0.10, and 21.0.2. An attacker can gain access to basic information about users of a server by accessing a public link that a legitimate server user added as a federated share. This happens because Nextcloud supports sharing registered users with other Nextcloud servers, which can be done automatically when selecting the \"Add server automatically once a federated share was created successfully\" setting. The vulnerability is patched in versions 19.0.11, 20.0.10, and 21.0.2 As a workaround, disable \"Add server automatically once a federated share was created successfully\" in the Nextcloud settings.\n\nAffected: nextcloud security-advisories < 19.0.11, >= 20.0.0, < 20.0.10, >= 21.0.0, < 21.0.2\n\nA security issue has been found in Nextcloud Server before version 21.0.2. Nextcloud supports sharing of the registered users with other Nextcloud servers. Nextcloud supports adding these automated when selecting the \"Add server automatically once a federated share was created successfully\" setting.\r\n\r\nAs a public link can be added as federated share, an attacker can trigger this exchange if they have access to a public link, thus getting access to basic user information.",
