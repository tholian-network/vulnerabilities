	"description": "An FR-GV-301 issue in FreeRADIUS 3.x before 3.0.15 allows \"Write overflow in data2vp_wimax()\" - this allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n\nA security issue has been found in freeradius <= 3.0.15, where the data2vp_wimax() function checks for WiMAX attributes which are too small, but it does not check for WiMAX attributes which are too large. As a result, the server can be convinced to read past the end of an attribute, and to write past the end of memory allocated via malloc(). A remote attacker with the ability to send packets which are accepted by the server can cause a write overflow, possibly leading to remote code execution.",
