	"id": "CVE-2021-39187",
	"description": "Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to version 4.10.3, Parse Server crashes when if a query request contains an invalid value for the `explain` option. This is due to a bug in the MongoDB Node.js driver which throws an exception that Parse Server cannot catch. There is a patch for this issue in version 4.10.3. No workarounds aside from upgrading are known to exist.\n\nAffected: parse-community parse-server < 4.10.3",
