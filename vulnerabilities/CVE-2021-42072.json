	"id": "CVE-2021-42072",
	"description": "An issue was discovered in Barrier before 2.4.0. The barriers component (aka the server-side implementation of Barrier) does not sufficiently verify the identify of connecting clients. Clients can thus exploit weaknesses in the provided protocol to cause denial-of-service or stage further attacks that could lead to information leaks or integrity corruption.\n\nA security issue has been found in Barrier before version 2.4.0. Contrary to the client side, the server does not verify client connections in any way. Since the server is taking over control of the client this may seem enough at first glance. However it means that the SSL connection does not add any authenticity or authentication for the server side. The server process thus provides attack surface to any member of the attached network.",
