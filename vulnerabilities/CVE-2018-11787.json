	"id": "CVE-2018-11787",
	"description": "In Apache Karaf version prior to 3.0.9, 4.0.9, 4.1.1, when the webconsole feature is installed in Karaf, it is available at .../system/console and requires authentication to access it. One part of the console is a Gogo shell/console that gives access to the command line console of Karaf via a Web browser, and when navigated to it is available at .../system/console/gogo. Trying to go directly to that URL does require authentication. And optional bundle that some applications use is the Pax Web Extender Whiteboard, it is part of the pax-war feature and perhaps others. When it is installed, the Gogo console becomes available at another URL .../gogo/, and that URL is not secured giving access to the Karaf console to unauthenticated users. A mitigation for the issue is to manually stop/uninstall Gogo plugin bundle that is installed with the webconsole feature, although of course this removes the console from the .../system/console application, not only from the unauthenticated endpoint. One could also stop/uninstall the Pax Web Extender Whiteboard, but other components/applications may require it and so their functionality would be reduced/compromised.\n\nAffected: Apache Software Foundation Apache Karaf prior to 3.0.9, 4.0.x prior to 4.0.9, 4.1.x prior to 4.1.1\n\nAffected: Apache Software Foundation Apache Karaf < 3.0.9, 4.0.x prior to 4.0.9, 4.1.x prior to 4.1.1\n\nAffected: Apache Software Foundation Apache Karaf < 3.0.9, 4.0.x prior to 4.0.9, 4.1.x prior to 4.1.1",
