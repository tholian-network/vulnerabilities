	"id": "CVE-2021-42076",
	"description": "A security issue has been found in Barrier before version 2.3.4. There is no check against overlong messages being sent by clients, so they can send up to 2^32 - 1 bytes, causing unauthenticated remote denial of service via excessive heap memory allocations. Multiple connections can be used to abuse this in parallel and cause even higher memory allocation, if necessary.",
