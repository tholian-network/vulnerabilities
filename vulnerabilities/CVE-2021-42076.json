	"id": "CVE-2021-42076",
	"description": "An issue was discovered in Barrier before 2.3.4. An attacker can cause memory exhaustion in the barriers component (aka the server-side implementation of Barrier) and barrierc by sending long TCP messages.\n\nA security issue has been found in Barrier before version 2.3.4. There is no check against overlong messages being sent by clients, so they can send up to 2^32 - 1 bytes, causing unauthenticated remote denial of service via excessive heap memory allocations. Multiple connections can be used to abuse this in parallel and cause even higher memory allocation, if necessary.",
