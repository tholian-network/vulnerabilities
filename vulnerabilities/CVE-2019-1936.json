	"description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) Supervisor, Cisco UCS Director, and Cisco UCS Director Express for Big Data could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux shell as the root user. Exploitation of this vulnerability requires privileged access to an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the web-based management interface with administrator privileges and then sending a malicious request to a certain part of the interface.\n\nAffected: Cisco Cisco Unified Computing System Director  < 6.7.3.0\n\nAffected: Cisco Cisco Unified Computing System Director 6.7.3.0\n\nAffected: Cisco Cisco Unified Computing System Director 6.7.3.0",
