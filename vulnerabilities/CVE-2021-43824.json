	"description": "Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications. In affected versions a crafted request crashes Envoy when a CONNECT request is sent to JWT filter configured with regex match. This provides a denial of service attack vector. The only workaround is to not use regex in the JWT filter. Users are advised to upgrade.\n\nAffected: envoyproxy envoy >= 1.20.0, < 1.20.2, >= 1.19.0, < 1.19.3, < 1.18.6, >= 1.21.0, < 1.21.1\n\nAffected: envoyproxy envoy >= 1.20.0, < 1.20.2, >= 1.19.0, < 1.19.3, < 1.18.6, >= 1.21.0, < 1.21.1",
