	"id": "CVE-2016-6843",
	"description": "An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX App Suite before 7.8.2-rev8. Script code can be injected to contact names. When adding those contacts to a group, the script code gets executed in the context of the user which creates or changes the group by using autocomplete. In most cases this is a user with elevated permissions. Malicious script code can be executed within a user's context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface (sending mail, deleting data etc.).",
