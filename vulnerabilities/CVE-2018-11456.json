	"id": "CVE-2018-11456",
	"description": "A vulnerability has been identified in Automation License Manager 5 (All versions < 5.3.4.4). An attacker with network access to the device could send specially crafted network packets to determine whether or not a network port on another remote system is accessible or not. This allows the attacker to do basic network scanning using the victims machine. Successful exploitation requires a network connection to the affected device. The attacker does not need privileges, no user interaction is required. The impact is limited to determining whether or not a port on a target system is accessible by the affected device.\n\nAffected: Siemens AG Automation License Manager 5 Automation License Manager 5 : All versions < 5.3.4.4\n\nAffected: Siemens AG Automation License Manager 5 Automation License Manager 5 : All versions < 5.3.4.4",
