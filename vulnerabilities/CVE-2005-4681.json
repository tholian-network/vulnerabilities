	"description": "Buffer overflow in mIRC 5.91, 6.03, 6.12, and 6.16 allows local users to execute arbitrary code via a long string that is entered after reaching the DCC Get Folder Dialog.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the vendor, saying \"as far as I can tell, this is neither an exploit nor a vulnerability. The above report describes a local bug in mIRC.\"  It could be that this is only exploitable by the user of the application, and thus would not cross privilege boundaries unless under an otherwise restrictive environment such as a kiosk",
