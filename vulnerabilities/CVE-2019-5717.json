	"id": "CVE-2019-5717",
	"description": "In Wireshark 2.6.0 to 2.6.5 and 2.4.0 to 2.4.11, the P_MUL dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-p_mul.c by rejecting the invalid sequence number of zero.\n\nA NULL-pointer dereference has been found in the P_MUL dissector of Wireshark versions prior to 2.6.6, which could be triggered by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.",
