	"description": "A vulnerability was found in PowerDNS Authoritative Server before 4.0.7 and before 4.1.7. An insufficient validation of data coming from the user when building a HTTP request from a DNS query in the HTTP Connector of the Remote backend, allowing a remote user to cause a denial of service by making the server connect to an invalid endpoint, or possibly information disclosure by making the server connect to an internal endpoint and somehow extracting meaningful information about the response\n\nAn issue has been found in PowerDNS Authoritative Server before 4.1.7, when the HTTP remote backend is used in RESTful mode (without post=1 set), allowing a remote user to cause the HTTP backend to connect to an attacker-specified host instead of the configured one, via a crafted DNS query. This can be used to cause a denial of service by preventing the remote backend from getting a response, content spoofing if the attacker can time its own query so that subsequent queries will use an attacker-controlled HTTP server instead of the configured one, and possibly information disclosure if the Authoritative Server has access to internal servers.",
