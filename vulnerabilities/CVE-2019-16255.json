	"id": "CVE-2019-16255",
	"description": "Ruby through 2.4.7, 2.5.x through 2.5.6, and 2.6.x through 2.6.4 allows code injection if the first argument (aka the \"command\" argument) to Shell#[] or Shell#test in lib/shell.rb is untrusted data. An attacker can exploit this to call an arbitrary Ruby method.\n\nIt has been discovered that Ruby before 2.4.8, 2.5.7 and 2.6.5 is vulnerable to code injection. Shell#[] and its alias Shell#test defined in lib/shell.rb allow code injection if the first argument (aka the “command” argument) is untrusted data. An attacker can exploit this to call an arbitrary Ruby method.",
