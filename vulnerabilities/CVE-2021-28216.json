	"description": "BootPerformanceTable pointer is read from an NVRAM variable in PEI. Recommend setting PcdFirmwarePerformanceDataTableS3Support to FALSE.\n\nA security issue has been found in edk2 before version 202111. In the function FpdtStatusCodeListenerPei(), the pointer BootPerformanceTable is read directly from an NVRAM variable (\"FirmwarePerformance\"). Memory is then updated at that address.  A local attacker may modify the variable at his will, and after reboot the vulnerable code will update memory at the attacker-supplied address.",
