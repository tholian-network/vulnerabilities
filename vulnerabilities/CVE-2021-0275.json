	"description": "A Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in J-Web on Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker to target another user's session thereby gaining access to the users session. The other user session must be active for the attack to succeed. Once successful, the attacker has the same privileges as the user. If the user has root privileges, the attacker may be able to gain full control of the device.
