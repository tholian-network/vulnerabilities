{
	"id": "CVE-2021-33195",
	"description": "Go before 1.15.13 and 1.16.x before 1.16.5 has functions for DNS lookups that do not validate replies from DNS servers, and thus a return value may contain an unsafe injection (e.g., XSS) that does not conform to the RFC1035 format.\n\nA security issue has been found in Go before version 1.16.5. The LookupCNAME, LookupSRV, LookupMX, LookupNS, and LookupAddr functions in net, and their respective methods on the Resolver type may return arbitrary values retrieved from DNS which do not follow the established RFC 1035 rules for domain names. If these names are used without further sanitization, for instance unsafely included in HTML, they may allow for injection of unexpected content. Note that LookupTXT may still return arbitrary values that could require sanitization before further use.",
