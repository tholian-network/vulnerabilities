	"id": "CVE-2017-16857",
	"description": "It is possible to bypass the bitbucket auto-unapprove plugin via minimal brute-force because it is relying on asynchronous events on the back-end. This allows an attacker to merge any code into unsuspecting repositories. This affects all versions of the auto-unapprove plugin, however since the auto-unapprove plugin is not bundled with Bitbucket Server it does not affect any particular version of Bitbucket.\n\nAffected: Atlassian Auto-Unapprove Plugin (for Bitbucket Server) All versions prior to version 3.0.1\n\nAffected: Atlassian Auto-Unapprove Plugin (for Bitbucket Server) < 3.0.1\n\nAffected: Atlassian Auto-Unapprove Plugin (for Bitbucket Server) < 3.0.1",
