	"id": "CVE-2017-16035",
	"description": "The hubl-server module is a wrapper for the HubL Development Server. During installation hubl-server downloads a set of dependencies from api.hubapi.com. It appears in the code that these files are downloaded over HTTPS however the api.hubapi.com endpoint redirects to a HTTP url. Because of this behavior an attacker with the ability to man-in-the-middle a developer or system performing a package installation could compromise the integrity of the installation.",
