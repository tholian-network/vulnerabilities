	"description": "Versions affected: BIND 9.18.0 When a vulnerable version of named receives a series of specific queries, the named process will eventually terminate due to a failed assertion check.\n\nBIND 9.18.0 stable release refactored the RFC 8198 Aggressive Use of DNSSEC-Validated Cache feature (synth-from-dnssec) and changed the default so that is now automatically enabled for dnssec-validating resolvers. Subsequently it was found that repeated patterns of specific queries to servers with this feature enabled could cause an INSIST failure in query.c:query_dname which causes named to terminate unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability affects BIND resolvers running 9.18.0 that have both dnssec-validation and synth-from-dnssec enabled. (Note that dnssec-validation auto; is the default setting unless configured otherwise in named.conf and that enabling dnssec-validation automatically enables synth-from-dnssec unless explicitly disabled) When a vulnerable version of named receives a series of specific queries, the named process will eventually terminate due to a failed assertion check.",
