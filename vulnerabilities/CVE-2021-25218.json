Also, version 9.16.19-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition When a vulnerable version of named receives a query under the circumstances described above, the named process will terminate due to a failed assertion check. The vulnerability affects only BIND 9 releases 9.16.19, 9.17.16, and release 9.16.19-S1 of the BIND Supported Preview Edition.\n\nIn BIND before version 9.16.20, if \"named\" attempts to respond over UDP with a response that is larger than the current effective interface maximum transmission unit (MTU), and if response-rate limiting (RRL) is active, an assertion failure is triggered (resulting in termination of the \"named\" server process).",
