{
	"id": "CVE-2021-37651",
	"description": "In TensorFlow before version 2.6.0 the implementation for tf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPoolGrad can be tricked into accessing data outside of bounds of heap allocated buffers. The implementation does not validate that the input tensor is non-empty. Thus, code constructs an empty EigenDoubleMatrixMap and then accesses this buffer with indices that are outside of the empty area.",
