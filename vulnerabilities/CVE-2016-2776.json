{
	"id": "CVE-2016-2776",
	"description": "buffer.c in named in ISC BIND 9 before 9.9.9-P3, 9.10.x before 9.10.4-P3, and 9.11.x before 9.11.0rc3 does not properly construct responses, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via a crafted query.\n\nTesting by ISC has uncovered a critical error condition which can occur when a nameserver is constructing a response. A defect in the rendering of messages into packets can cause named to exit with an assertion failure in buffer.c while constructing a response to a query that meets certain criteria.\nThis assertion can be triggered even if the apparent source address isn't allowed to make queries (i.e. doesn't match 'allow-query').",
