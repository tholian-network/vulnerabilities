	"id": "CVE-2010-3171",
	"description": "The Math.random function in the JavaScript implementation in Mozilla Firefox 3.5.10 through 3.5.11, 3.6.4 through 3.6.8, and 4.0 Beta1 uses a random number generator that is seeded only once per document object, which makes it easier for remote attackers to track a user, or trick a user into acting upon a spoofed pop-up message, by calculating the seed value, related to a \"temporary footprint\" and an \"in-session phishing attack.\" NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2008-5913.",
