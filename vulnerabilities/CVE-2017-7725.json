	"id": "CVE-2017-7725",
	"description": "concrete5 8.1.0 places incorrect trust in the HTTP Host header during caching, if the administrator did not define a \"canonical\" URL on installation of concrete5 using the \"Advanced Options\" settings. Remote attackers can make a GET request with any domain name in the Host header; this is stored and allows for arbitrary domains to be set for certain links displayed to subsequent visitors, potentially an XSS vector.",
