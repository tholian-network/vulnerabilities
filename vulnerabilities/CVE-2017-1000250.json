	"id": "CVE-2017-1000250",
	"description": "All versions of the SDP server in BlueZ 5.46 and earlier are vulnerable to an information disclosure vulnerability which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from the bluetoothd process memory. This vulnerability lies in the processing of SDP search attribute requests.\n\nAn information-disclosure flaw was found in the bluetoothd implementation of the Service Discovery Protocol (SDP). A specially crafted Bluetooth device could, without prior pairing or user interaction, retrieve portions of the bluetoothd process memory, including potentially sensitive information such as Bluetooth encryption keys.",
