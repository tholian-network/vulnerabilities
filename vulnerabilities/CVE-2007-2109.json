	"description": "Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Oracle Database 10.2.0.3 have unknown impact and remote authenticated attack vectors related to (1) Rules Manager and Expression Filter components (DB02) and (2) Oracle Streams (DB06).  Note: as of 20070424, Oracle has not disputed reliable claims that DB02 is for a race condition in the RLMGR_TRUNCATE_MAINT trigger in the Rules Manager and Expression Filter components changing the AUTHID of a package from DEFINER to CURRENT_USER after a TRUNCATE call, and DB06 is for SQL injection in the DBMS_APPLY_USER_AGENT.SET_REGISTRATION_HANDLER procedure, which is later passed to the DBMS_APPLY_ADM_INTERNAL.ALTER_APPLY procedure, aka \"Oracle Streams\".",
