	"description": "An issue has been found in the API component of PowerDNS Authoritative < 4.0.5, where some operations that have an impact on the state of the server are still allowed even though the API has been configured as read-only via the 'api-readonly' keyword. This missing check allows an attacker with valid API credentials to flush the cache, trigger a zone transfer or send a NOTIFY.",
