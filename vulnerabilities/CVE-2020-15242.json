Specially encoded paths could be used with the trailing slash redirect to allow an open redirect to occur to an external site.

The issue is fixed in version 9.5.4.\n\nAffected: vercel next.js >= 9.5.0, <9.5.4\n\nAffected: vercel next.js >= 9.5.0, < 9.5.4\n\nAffected: vercel next.js >= 9.5.0, < 9.5.4",
