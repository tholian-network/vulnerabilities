	"id": "CVE-2016-5284",
	"description": "Mozilla Firefox before 49.0, Firefox ESR 45.x before 45.4, and Thunderbird < 45.4 rely on unintended expiration dates for Preloaded Public Key Pinning, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof add-on updates by leveraging possession of an X.509 server certificate for addons.mozilla.org signed by an arbitrary built-in Certification Authority.\n\nDue to flaws in the process used to update \"Preloaded Public Key Pinning\", the pinning for add-on updates became ineffective in early September. An attacker who was able to get a mis-issued certificate for a Mozilla web site could send malicious add-on updates to users on networks controlled by the attacker. Users who have not installed any add-ons are not affected.",
