	"description": "A security issue has been found in OpenJDK before versions 7u321 and 8u312 in the hotspot/runtime component. A difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise OpenJDK. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of OpenJDK.\r\n\r\nNote : This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a web service which supplies data to the APIs.",
