	"id": "CVE-2021-36766",
	"description": "Concrete5 through 8.5.5 deserializes Untrusted Data. The vulnerable code is located within the controllers/single_page/dashboard/system/environment/logging.php Logging::update_logging() method. User input passed through the logFile request parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a call to the file_exists() PHP function. This can be exploited by malicious users to inject arbitrary PHP objects into the application scope (PHP Object Injection via phar:// stream wrapper), allowing them to carry out a variety of attacks, such as executing arbitrary PHP code.",
