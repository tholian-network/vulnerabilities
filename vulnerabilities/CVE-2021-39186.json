	"description": "GlobalNewFiles is a MediaWiki extension maintained by Miraheze. Prior to commit number cee254e1b158cdb0ddbea716b1d3edc31fa4fb5d, the username column of the GlobalNewFiles special page is vulnerable to a stored XSS. Commit number cee254e1b158cdb0ddbea716b1d3edc31fa4fb5d contains a patch. As a workaround, one may disallow <,> (or other characters required to insert html/js) from being used in account names so an XSS is not possible.\n\nAffected: miraheze GlobalNewFiles < cee254e1b158cdb0ddbea716b1d3edc31fa4fb5d\n\nAffected: miraheze GlobalNewFiles < cee254e1b158cdb0ddbea716b1d3edc31fa4fb5d",
