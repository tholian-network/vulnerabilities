	"id": "CVE-2021-31425",
	"description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Parallels Desktop 16.1.2-49151. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the Parallels Tools component. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer overflow before allocating a buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel on the target guest system. Was ZDI-CAN-12790.\n\nAffected: Parallels Desktop 16.1.2-49151\n\nAffected: Parallels Desktop <= 49151\n\nAffected: Parallels Desktop <= 49151",
