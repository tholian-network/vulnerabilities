	"description": "Multiple exploitable buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the credentials handler of video-core's HTTP server of Samsung SmartThings Hub STH-ETH-250 devices with firmware version 0.20.17. The video-core process incorrectly extracts fields from a user-controlled JSON payload, leading to a buffer overflow on the stack. A strncpy overflows the destination buffer, which has a size of 16 bytes. An attacker can send an arbitrarily long \"region\" value in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nAffected: Samsung SmartThings Hub STH-ETH-250 Firmware version 0.20.17\n\nAffected: Samsung SmartThings Hub STH-ETH-250 Firmware version 0.20.17",
