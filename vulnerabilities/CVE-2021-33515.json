	"id": "CVE-2021-33515",
	"description": "The submission service in Dovecot before 2.3.15 allows STARTTLS command injection in lib-smtp. Sensitive information can be redirected to an attacker-controlled address.\n\nA security issue has been found in Dovecot before version 2.3.14.1. An on-path attacker could inject plaintext commands before the STARTTLS negotiation that would be executed after STARTTLS finished with the client. Only the SMTP submission service is affected. As a result, an attacker can potentially steal user credentials and emails. The attacker needs to have sending permissions on the submission server (a valid username and password).",
