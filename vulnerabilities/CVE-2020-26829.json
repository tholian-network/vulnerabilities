	"description": "SAP NetWeaver AS JAVA (P2P Cluster Communication), versions - 7.11, 7.20, 7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50, allows arbitrary connections from processes because of missing authentication check, that are outside the cluster and even outside the network segment dedicated for the internal cluster communication. As result, an unauthenticated attacker can invoke certain functions that would otherwise be restricted to system administrators only, including access to system administration functions or shutting down the system completely.\n\nAffected: SAP SE SAP NetWeaver AS JAVA (P2P Cluster Communication) < 7.11, < 7.20, < 7.30, < 7.31, < 7.40, < 7.50",
