	"description": "A flaw was found in Ansible Tower, versions 3.6.x before 3.6.2 and 3.5.x before 3.5.3, where enabling RabbitMQ manager by setting it with '-e rabbitmq_enable_manager=true' exposes the RabbitMQ management interface publicly, as expected. If the default admin user is still active, an attacker could guess the password and gain access to the system.\n\nAffected: Red Hat Tower ansible_tower versions 3.6.x before 3.6.2, ansible_tower versions 3.5.x before 3.5.4\n\nAffected: Red Hat Tower ansible_tower versions 3.6.x before 3.6.2, ansible_tower versions 3.5.x before 3.5.4",
