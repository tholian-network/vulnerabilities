{
	"id": "CVE-2021-41217",
	"description": "In TensorFlow before version 2.6.1, the process of building the control flow graph for a TensorFlow model is vulnerable to a null pointer exception when nodes that should be paired are not. This occurs because the code assumes that the first node in the pairing (e.g., an Enter node) always exists when encountering the second node (e.g., an Exit node). When this is not the case, parent is nullptr so dereferencing it causes a crash.",
