	"id": "CVE-2021-41230",
	"description": "Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. In affected versions changes to the OIDC claims of a user after initial login are not reflected in policy evaluation when using `allowed_idp_claims` as part of policy. If using `allowed_idp_claims` and a user's claims are changed, Pomerium can make incorrect authorization decisions. This issue has been resolved in v0.15.6. For users unable to upgrade clear data on `databroker` service by clearing redis or restarting the in-memory databroker to force claims to be updated.\n\nAffected: pomerium pomerium >= 0.14.0, < 0.15.6\n\nAffected: pomerium pomerium >= 0.14.0, < 0.15.6",
