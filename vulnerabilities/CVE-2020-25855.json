{
	"id": "CVE-2020-25855",
	"description": "The function AES_UnWRAP() in the Realtek RTL8195A Wi-Fi Module prior to versions released in April 2020 (up to and excluding 2.08) does not validate the size parameter for a memcpy() operation, resulting in a stack buffer overflow which can be exploited for remote code execution or denial of service. An attacker can impersonate an Access Point and attack a vulnerable Wi-Fi client, by injecting a crafted packet into the WPA2 handshake. The attacker needs to know the network's PSK in order to exploit this.\n\nAffected: n/a Realtek RTL8195A Wi-Fi Module Versions before 2020-04-21 (up to and excluding 2.08)",
