	"id": "CVE-2019-9186",
	"description": "In several JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA versions, a Spring Boot run configuration with the default setting allowed remote attackers to execute code when the configuration is running, because a JMX server listens on all interfaces (instead of listening on only the localhost interface). This issue has been fixed in the following versions: 2019.1, 2018.3.4, 2018.2.8, 2018.1.8, and 2017.3.7.",
