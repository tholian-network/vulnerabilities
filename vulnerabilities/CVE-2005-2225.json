	"description": "Microsoft MSN Messenger allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a plaintext message containing the \".pif\" string, which is interpreted as a malicious file extension and causes users to be kicked from a group conversation. NOTE: it has been reported that Gaim is also affected, so this may be an issue in the protocol or MSN servers.",
