	"description": "An information disclosure issue has been found in Firefox before 82.0 where if a valid external protocol handler was referenced in an image tag, the resulting broken image size could be distinguished from a broken image size of a non-existent protocol handler. This allowed an attacker to successfully probe whether an external protocol handler was registered.",
