	"id": "CVE-2022-24722",
	"description": "VIewComponent is a framework for building view components in Ruby on Rails. Versions prior to 2.31.2 and 2.49.1 contain a cross-site scripting vulnerability that has the potential to impact anyone using translations with the view_component gem. Data received via user input and passed as an interpolation argument to the `translate` method is not properly sanitized before display. Versions 2.31.2 and 2.49.1 have been released and fully mitigate the vulnerability. As a workaround, avoid passing user input to the `translate` function, or sanitize the inputs before passing them.\n\nAffected: github view_component >= 2.31.0, < 2.31.2, >= 2.32.0, < 2.49.1\n\nAffected: github view_component >= 2.31.0, < 2.31.2, >= 2.32.0, < 2.49.1",
