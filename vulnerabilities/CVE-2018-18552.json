	"id": "CVE-2018-18552",
	"description": "ServersCheck Monitoring Software through 14.3.3 allows local users to cause a denial of service (menu functionality loss) by creating an LNK file that points to a second LNK file, if this second LNK file is associated with a Start menu. Ultimately, this behavior comes from a Directory Traversal bug (via the sensor_details.html id parameter) that allows creating empty files in arbitrary directories.",
