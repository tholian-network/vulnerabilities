	"id": "CVE-2020-11945",
	"description": "An issue was discovered in Squid before 5.0.2. A remote attacker can replay a sniffed Digest Authentication nonce to gain access to resources that are otherwise forbidden. This occurs because the attacker can overflow the nonce reference counter (a short integer). Remote code execution may occur if the pooled token credentials are freed (instead of replayed as valid credentials).\n\nAn integer overflow has been found in Squid before 4.11 or 5.0.2. When memory pooling is used this problem allows a remote client to replay a sniffed Digest Authentication nonce to gain access to resources that are otherwise forbidden. When memory pooling is disabled this problem allows a remote client to perform remote code execution through the free'd nonce credentials.",
