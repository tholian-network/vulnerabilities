{
	"id": "CVE-2020-15466",
	"description": "In Wireshark 3.2.0 to 3.2.4, the GVCP dissector could go into an infinite loop. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-gvcp.c by ensuring that an offset increases in all situations.\n\nAn infinite loop has been found in the GVCP dissector of Wireshark before 3.2.5. It may be possible to make Wireshark consume excessive CPU resources by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.",
