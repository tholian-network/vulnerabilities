	"id": "CVE-2021-41160",
	"description": "FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), released under the Apache license. In affected versions a malicious server might trigger out of bound writes in a connected client. Connections using GDI or SurfaceCommands to send graphics updates to the client might send `0` width/height or out of bound rectangles to trigger out of bound writes. With `0` width or heigth the memory allocation will be `0` but the missing bounds checks allow writing to the pointer at this (not allocated) region. This issue has been patched in FreeRDP 2.4.1.\n\nA security issue has been found in FreeRDP before version 2.4.1. A malicious server might trigger out of bound writes in a connected client.\r\n\r\nConnections using GDI or SurfaceCommands to send graphics updates to the client might send 0 width/height or out of bound rectangles to trigger out of bound writes. With 0 width or heigth the memory allocation will be 0 but the missing bounds checks allow writing to the pointer at this (not allocated) region.",
