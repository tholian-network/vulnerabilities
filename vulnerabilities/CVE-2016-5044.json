	"id": "CVE-2016-5044",
	"description": "The WRITE_UNALIGNED function in dwarf_elf_access.c in libdwarf before 20160923 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write and crash) via a crafted DWARF section.\n\nA vulnerability was found in libdwarf in dwarf_elf_access.c:1071. A crafted ELF file may lead to a large offset value, which bigger than the size of target_section heap chunk, then this WRITE_UNALIGNED() function will write the value of &outval out of the heap chunk. The offset is a 64bit unsigned int value, so this is more than a heap overflow bug, but also a out-of-bound write bug.",
