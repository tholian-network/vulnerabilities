	"description": "Ametys before 4.0.3 requires authentication only for URIs containing a /cms/ substring, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a direct request to /plugins/core-ui/servercomm/messages.xml, as demonstrated by changing the admin password by obtaining account details via a users/search.json request, and then modifying the account via an editUser request.",
