	"description": "In Django 2.2 before 2.2.21, 3.1 before 3.1.9, and 3.2 before 3.2.1, MultiPartParser, UploadedFile, and FieldFile allowed directory traversal via uploaded files with suitably crafted file names.\n\nA security issue has been found in Django before version 3.2.1. MultiPartParser, UploadedFile, and FieldFile allowed directory-traversal via uploaded files with suitably crafted file names. In order to mitigate this risk, stricter basename and path sanitation is now applied. Specifically, empty file names and paths with dot segments will be rejected.",
