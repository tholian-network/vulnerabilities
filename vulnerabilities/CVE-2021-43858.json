	"id": "CVE-2021-43858",
	"description": "MinIO is a Kubernetes native application for cloud storage. Prior to version `RELEASE.2021-12-27T07-23-18Z`, a malicious client can hand-craft an HTTP API call that allows for updating policy for a user and gaining higher privileges. The patch in version `RELEASE.2021-12-27T07-23-18Z` changes the accepted request body type and removes the ability to apply policy changes through this API. There is a workaround for this vulnerability: Changing passwords can be disabled by adding an explicit `Deny` rule to disable the API for users.\n\nAffected: minio minio < RELEASE.2021-12-27T07-23-18Z\n\nAffected: minio minio < RELEASE.2021-12-27T07-23-18Z",
