	"id": "CVE-2017-12342",
	"description": "A vulnerability in the Open Agent Container (OAC) feature of Cisco Nexus Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker to read and send packets outside the scope of the OAC. The vulnerability is due to insufficient internal security measures in the OAC feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting specific packets for communication on the device-internal network. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run code on the underlying host operating system. OAC is not enabled by default. For a device to be vulnerable, an administrator would need to install and activate this feature. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco Nexus Series Switches: Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders, Nexus 5000 Series Switches, Nexus 5500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5600 Platform Switches, Nexus 6000 Series Switches, Nexus 7000 Series Switches, Nexus 7700 Series Switches. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve53542, CSCvf36621.\n\nAffected: n/a Cisco Nexus Series Switches Cisco Nexus Series Switches",
