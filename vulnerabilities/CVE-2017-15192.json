	"description": "In Wireshark 2.4.0 to 2.4.1 and 2.2.0 to 2.2.9, the BT ATT dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-btatt.c by considering a case where not all of the BTATT packets have the same encapsulation level.\n\nA flaw has been discovered in wireshark before 2.4.2 in the BT ATT dissector leading to application crash by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.",
