	"description": "This affects Spring Data JPA in versions up to and including 2.1.5, 2.0.13 and 1.11.19. Derived queries using any of the predicates ‘startingWith’, ‘endingWith’ or ‘containing’ could return more results than anticipated when a maliciously crafted query parameter value is supplied. Also, LIKE expressions in manually defined queries could return unexpected results if the parameter values bound did not have escaped reserved characters properly.\n\nAffected: Spring Spring Boot < v2.0.9.RELEASE, < v1.5.20.RELEASE, < v2.1.4.RELEASE\n\nAffected: Spring Spring Boot v2.0.9.RELEASE, v1.5.20.RELEASE, v2.1.4.RELEASE\n\nAffected: Spring Spring Boot v2.0.9.RELEASE, v1.5.20.RELEASE, v2.1.4.RELEASE",
