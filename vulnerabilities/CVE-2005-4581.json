	"id": "CVE-2005-4581",
	"description": "Buffer overflow in Electric Sheep 2.6.3 client allows local users to execute arbitrary code via a long window-id parameter. NOTE: because the program is not setuid and not normally called from remote programs, there may not be a typical attack vector for the issue that crosses privilege boundaries.  Therefore this may not be a vulnerability.",
