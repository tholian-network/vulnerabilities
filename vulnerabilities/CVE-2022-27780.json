{
	"id": "CVE-2022-27780",
	"description": "The curl URL parser wrongly accepts percent-encoded URL separators like '/' when decoding the host name part of a URL, making it a *different* URL using the wrong host name when it is later retrieved. For example, a URL like `http://example.com%2F10.0.0.1/`, would be allowed by the parser and get transposed into `http://example.com/10.0.0.1/`. This flaw can be used to circumvent filters, checks and more.",
