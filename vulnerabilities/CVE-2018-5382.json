{
	"id": "CVE-2018-5382",
	"description": "The default BKS keystore use an HMAC that is only 16 bits long, which can allow an attacker to compromise the integrity of a BKS keystore. Bouncy Castle release 1.47 changes the BKS format to a format which uses a 160 bit HMAC instead. This applies to any BKS keystore generated prior to BC 1.47. For situations where people need to create the files for legacy reasons a specific keystore type \"BKS-V1\" was introduced in 1.49. It should be noted that the use of \"BKS-V1\" is discouraged by the library authors and should only be used where it is otherwise safe to do so, as in where the use of a 16 bit checksum for the file integrity check is not going to cause a security issue in itself.\n\nAffected: Legion of the Bouncy Castle Bouncy Castle < 1.47\n\nAffected: Legion of the Bouncy Castle Bouncy Castle 1.47\n\nAffected: Legion of the Bouncy Castle Bouncy Castle 1.47",
