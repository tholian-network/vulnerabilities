	"description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of certain Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges to inject arbitrary commands into the underlying operating system. When processed, the commands will be executed with root privileges. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing malicious input to a specific field in the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux operating system as the root user.",
