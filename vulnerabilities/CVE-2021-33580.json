	"id": "CVE-2021-33580",
	"description": "User controlled `request.getHeader(\"Referer\")`, `request.getRequestURL()` and `request.getQueryString()` are used to build and run a regex expression. The attacker doesn't have to use a browser and may send a specially crafted Referer header programmatically. Since the attacker controls the string and the regex pattern he may cause a ReDoS by regex catastrophic backtracking on the server side. This problem has been fixed in Roller 6.0.2.\n\nAffected: Apache Software Foundation Apache Roller < 6.0.2\n\nAffected: Apache Software Foundation Apache Roller 6.0.2\n\nAffected: Apache Software Foundation Apache Roller 6.0.2",
