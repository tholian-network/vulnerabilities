	"description": "In Wireshark 2.2.0 to 2.2.6 and 2.0.0 to 2.0.12, the Bluetooth L2CAP dissector could divide by zero. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-btl2cap.c by validating an interval value.\n\nAn issue has been found in the BT L2CAP dissector of Wireshark < 2.2.7, where a division by zero can be triggered by injecting a malicious packet into the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.",
