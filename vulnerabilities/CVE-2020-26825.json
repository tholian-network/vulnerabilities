Information maintained in the victim's web browser can be read, modified, and sent to the attacker. The malicious code cannot significantly impact the victim's browser and the victim can easily close the browser tab to terminate it.\n\nAffected: SAP SE SAP Fiori Launchpad (News Tile Application) < 750, < 751, < 752, < 753, < 754, < 755",
