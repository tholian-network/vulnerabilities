	"id": "CVE-2019-10104",
	"description": "In several JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate versions, an Application Server run configuration (for Tomcat, Jetty, Resin, or CloudBees) with the default setting allowed a remote attacker to execute code when the configuration is running, because a JMX server listened on all interfaces instead of localhost only. The issue has been fixed in the following versions: 2018.3.4, 2018.2.8, 2018.1.8, and 2017.3.7.",
