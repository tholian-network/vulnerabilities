	"id": "CVE-2020-3255",
	"description": "A vulnerability in the packet processing functionality of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to inefficient memory management. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of IPv4 or IPv6 traffic through an affected device. This traffic would need to match a configured block action in an access control policy. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a memory exhaustion condition on the affected device, which would result in a DoS for traffic transiting the device, as well as sluggish performance of the management interface. Once the flood is stopped, performance should return to previous states.",
