	"description": "Format string vulnerability in /bin/ftp in UNICOS 9.0.2.2 allows local users to have an unknown impact via format string specifiers in the quote command.  NOTE: because the program is not setuid and not normally called from remote programs, there may not be a typical attack vector for the issue that crosses privilege boundaries. Therefore this may not be a vulnerability.",
