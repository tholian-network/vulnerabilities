	"description": "An issue was discovered in certain Apple products. iOS before 10.2.1 is affected. Safari before 10.0.3 is affected. iCloud before 6.1.1 is affected. iTunes before 12.5.5 is affected. The issue involves the \"WebKit\" component. It allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) via a crafted web site.\n\nSeveral memory corruption issues have been found in WebKitGTK+ before 2.14.4, leading to arbitrary code execution while processing maliciously crafted web content.",
