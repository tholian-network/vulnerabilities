This behavior could make future session hijacking attempts easier, since the user could believe a session was closed when it was not. This issue affects Rapid7 AppSpider version 3.8.213 and prior versions, and is fixed in version 3.8.215.\n\nAffected: Rapid7 AppSpider <= 3.8.213\n\nAffected: Rapid7 AppSpider 3.8.213\n\nAffected: Rapid7 AppSpider 3.8.213",
