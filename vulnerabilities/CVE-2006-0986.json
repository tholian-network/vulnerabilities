{
	"id": "CVE-2006-0986",
	"description": "WordPress 2.0.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a direct request to (1) default-filters.php, (2) template-loader.php, (3) rss-functions.php, (4) locale.php, (5) wp-db.php, and (6) kses.php in the wp-includes/ directory; and (7) edit-form-advanced.php, (8) admin-functions.php, (9) edit-link-form.php, (10) edit-page-form.php, (11) admin-footer.php, and (12) menu.php in the wp-admin directory; and possibly (13) list directory contents of the wp-includes directory.  NOTE: the vars.php, edit-form.php, wp-settings.php, and edit-form-comment.php vectors are already covered by CVE-2005-4463.  The menu-header.php vector is already covered by CVE-2005-2110.  Other vectors might be covered by CVE-2005-1688.  NOTE: if the typical installation of WordPress does not list any site-specific files to wp-includes, then vector [13] is not an exposure.",
