	"id": "CVE-2022-24733",
	"description": "Sylius is an open source eCommerce platform. Prior to versions 1.9.10, 1.10.11, and 1.11.2, it is possible for a page controlled by an attacker to load the website within an iframe. This will enable a clickjacking attack, in which the attacker's page overlays the target application's interface with a different interface provided by the attacker. The issue is fixed in versions 1.9.10, 1.10.11, and 1.11.2. A workaround is available. Every response from app should have an X-Frame-Options header set to: ``sameorigin``. To achieve that, add a new `subscriber` in the app.\n\nAffected: Sylius Sylius < 1.9.10, >= 1.10.0, < 1.10.11, >= 1.11.0, < 1.11.2\n\nAffected: Sylius Sylius < 1.9.10, >= 1.10.0, < 1.10.11, >= 1.11.0, < 1.11.2",
