	"id": "CVE-2019-3825",
	"description": "A vulnerability was discovered in gdm before 3.31.4. When timed login is enabled in configuration, an attacker could bypass the lock screen by selecting the timed login user and waiting for the timer to expire, at which time they would gain access to the logged-in user's session.\n\nAn issue has been found in gdm <= 3.30.2, allowing a local attacker with valid credentials to unlock the session for a different user than their own.",
