	"description": "Datto Windows Agent allows unauthenticated remote command execution via a modified command in conjunction with CVE-2017-16673 exploitation, aka an attack with a malformed primary whitelisted command and a secondary non-whitelisted command. This affects Datto Windows Agent (DWA) 1.0.5.0 and earlier. In other words, an attacker could combine this \"primary/secondary\" attack with the CVE-2017-16673 \"rogue pairing\" attack to achieve unauthenticated access to all agent machines running these older DWA versions.",
