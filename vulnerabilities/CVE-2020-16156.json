	"id": "CVE-2020-16156",
	"description": "A flaw was found in the way the perl-CPAN 2.28 performed verification of package signatures stored in CHECKSUMS files. A malicious or compromised CPAN server used by a user, or a man-in-the-middle attacker, could use this flaw to bypass signature verification.\r\n\r\nAn attacker can prepend checksums for modified packages to the beginning of CHECKSUMS files, before the cleartext PGP headers. This makes the Module::Signature::_verify() checks in both cpan and cpanm pass. Without the sigtext and plaintext arguments to _verify(), the _compare() check is bypassed. This results in _verify() only checking that valid signed cleartext is present somewhere in the file.",
