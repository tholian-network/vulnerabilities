	"id": "CVE-2020-29511",
	"description": "Go's encoding/xml handles namespace prefixes on XML elements in a way that causes crafted markup to mutate during round-trips through the xml.Decoder and xml.Encoder implementations. Encoding and decoding using Go's encoding/xml can change the observed namespace as well as the observed local name of a maliciously crafted XML element.\r\n\r\nAffected applications include software that relies on XML integrity for security-sensitive decisions. Prominent examples of such applications include SAML and XML-DSig implementations.",
