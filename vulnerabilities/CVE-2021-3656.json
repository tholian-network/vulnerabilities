	"id": "CVE-2021-3656",
	"description": "A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nested virtualization. The flaw occurs when processing the VMCB (virtual machine control block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a nested guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the \"virt_ext\" field, this issue could allow a malicious L1 to disable both VMLOAD/VMSAVE intercepts and VLS (Virtual VMLOAD/VMSAVE) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest would be allowed to read/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape.\n\nA security issue has been found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nested virtualization in the Linux kernel before version 5.13.20. This issue is caused by missing validation of the the `virt_ext` VMCB field and allows a malicious L1 guest to disable both VMLOAD/VMSAVE intercepts and VLS (Virtual VMLOAD/VMSAVE) for the L2 guest. Under these circumstances, the L2 guest is able to run VMLOAD/VMSAVE unintercepted, and thus read/write portions of the host physical memory.",
