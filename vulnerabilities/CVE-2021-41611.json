	"description": "An issue was discovered in Squid 5.0.6 through 5.1.x before 5.2. When validating an origin server or peer certificate, Squid may incorrectly classify certain certificates as trusted. This problem allows a remote server to obtain security trust well improperly. This indication of trust may be passed along to clients, allowing access to unsafe or hijacked services.\n\nWhen validating an origin server or peer certificate, Squid 5 before version 5.2 may incorrectly classify certain certificates as trusted. This problem allows a remote server to obtain security trust when the trust is not valid. This indication of trust may be passed along to clients allowing access to unsafe or hijacked services.\r\n\r\nThis problem is guaranteed to occur when multiple CA have signed the TLS server certificate. It may also occur in cases of broken server certificate chains.",
