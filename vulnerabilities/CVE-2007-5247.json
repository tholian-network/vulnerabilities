	"description": "Multiple format string vulnerabilities in the Monolith Lithtech engine, as used by First Encounter Assault Recon (F.E.A.R.) 1.08 and earlier, when Punkbuster (PB) is enabled, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via format string specifiers in (1) a PB_Y packet to the YPG server on UDP port 27888 or (2) a PB_U packet to UCON on UDP port 27888, different vectors than CVE-2004-1500.  NOTE: this issue might be in Punkbuster itself, but there are insufficient details to be certain.",
