	"description": "The DOM level 2 implementation in WebKit, as used in Apple iTunes before 10.2 on Windows and Apple Safari, does not properly handle DOM manipulations associated with event listeners during processing of range objects, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) via vectors related to iTunes Store browsing, a different vulnerability than other CVEs listed in APPLE-SA-2011-03-02-1.",
