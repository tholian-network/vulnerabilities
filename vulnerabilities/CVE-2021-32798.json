	"description": "The Jupyter notebook is a web-based notebook environment for interactive computing. In affected versions untrusted notebook can execute code on load. Jupyter Notebook uses a deprecated version of Google Caja to sanitize user inputs. A public Caja bypass can be used to trigger an XSS when a victim opens a malicious ipynb document in Jupyter Notebook. The XSS allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim computer using Jupyter APIs.\n\nIn Jupyiter notebook before version 6.4.1, an untrusted notebook can execute code on load. Jupyter Notebook uses a deprecated version of Google Caja to sanitize user inputs. A public Caja bypass can be used to trigger a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack when a victim opens a malicious ipynb document in Jupyter Notebook.
