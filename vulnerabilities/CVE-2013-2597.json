	"description": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the acdb_ioctl function in audio_acdb.c in the acdb audio driver for the Linux kernel 2.6.x and 3.x, as used in Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC) Android contributions for MSM devices and other products, allows attackers to gain privileges via an application that leverages /dev/msm_acdb access and provides a large size value in an ioctl argument.\n\nThe Code Aurora audio calibration database (acdb) audio driver contains a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability which allows for privilege escalation. Code Aurora is used in third-party products such as Qualcomm and Android.",
