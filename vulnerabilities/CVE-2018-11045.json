	"description": "Pivotal Operations Manager, versions 2.1 prior to 2.1.6 and 2.0 prior to 2.0.15 and 1.12 prior to 1.12.22, contains a static Linux Random Number Generator (LRNG) seed file embedded in the appliance image. An attacker with knowledge of the exact version and IaaS of a running OpsManager could get the contents of the corresponding seed from the published image and therefore infer the initial state of the LRNG.\n\nAffected: Pivotal Pivotal Operations Manager < 2.1.6, < 2.0.15, < 1.12.22\n\nAffected: Pivotal Pivotal Operations Manager 2.1.6, 2.0.15, 1.12.22\n\nAffected: Pivotal Pivotal Operations Manager 2.1.6, 2.0.15, 1.12.22",
