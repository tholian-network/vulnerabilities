	"description": "The Responsive WordPress Slider WordPress plugin through 2.2.0 does not sanitise and escape some of the Slider options, allowing Cross-Site Scripting payloads to be set in them. Furthermore, as by default any authenticated user is allowed to create Sliders (https://wordpress.org/support/topic/slider-can-be-changed-from-any-user-even-subscriber/, such settings can be changed in the plugin's settings), this would allow user with a role as low as subscriber to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks against logged in admins viewing the slider list and could lead to privilege escalation by creating a rogue admin account for example.\n\nAffected: Unknown Responsive WordPress Slider <= 2.2.0\n\nAffected: Unknown Responsive WordPress Slider 2.2.0\n\nAffected: Unknown Responsive WordPress Slider 2.2.0",
