	"description": "cPanel does not automatically synchronize the PHP open_basedir configuration directive between the main server and virtual hosts that share physical directories, which might allow a local user to bypass open_basedir restrictions and access other virtual hosts via a PHP script that uses a main server URL (such as ~username) that is blocked by the user's own open_basedir directive, but not the main server's open_basedir directive.",
