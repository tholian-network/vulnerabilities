	"id": "CVE-2021-41167",
	"description": "modern-async is an open source JavaScript tooling library for asynchronous operations using async/await and promises. In affected versions a bug affecting two of the functions in this library: forEachSeries and forEachLimit. They should limit the concurrency of some actions but, in practice, they don't. Any code calling these functions will be written thinking they would limit the concurrency but they won't. This could lead to potential security issues in other projects. The problem has been patched in 1.0.4. There is no workaround.\n\nAffected: nicolas-van modern-async < 1.0.4\n\nAffected: nicolas-van modern-async < 1.0.4",
