	"id": "CVE-2019-16866",
	"description": "Unbound before 1.9.4 accesses uninitialized memory, which allows remote attackers to trigger a crash via a crafted NOTIFY query. The source IP address of the query must match an access-control rule.\n\nDue to an error in parsing NOTIFY queries, it is possible for Unbound from 1.7.1 up to and including 1.9.3 to continue processing malformed queries and may ultimately result in a pointer dereference in uninitialized memory. This results in a crash of the Unbound daemon.",
