	"id": "CVE-2021-43298",
	"description": "The code that performs password matching when using 'Basic' HTTP authentication does not use a constant-time memcmp and has no rate-limiting. This means that an unauthenticated network attacker can brute-force the HTTP basic password, byte-by-byte, by recording the webserver's response time until the unauthorized (401) response.\n\nAffected: embedthis goahead < 5.1.4",
