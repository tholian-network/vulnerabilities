	"description": "Sulu is an open-source PHP content management system based on the Symfony framework. In versions of Sulu prior to 1.6.41, it is possible for a logged in admin user to add a script injection (cross-site-scripting) in the collection title. The problem is patched in version 1.6.41. As a workaround, one may manually patch the affected JavaScript files in lieu of updating.",
