	"description": "A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the virtio-net device of QEMU. It could occur when the descriptor's address belongs to the non direct access region, due to num_buffers being set after the virtqueue elem has been unmapped. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash QEMU, resulting in a denial of service condition, or potentially execute code on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.\n\nOSS-Fuzz found a use-after-free vulnerability in virtio-net. It occurs in the iov_from_buf_full function under these conditions:\r\n\r\n1) the (malicious) driver tries to add a non direct memory region as the buffer address\r\n2) then memory core needs to use the bounce buffer\r\n3) virtio-net tries to set the num_buffers *after* the iov is unmapped (bounce buffer is freed)\r\n\r\nA malicious guest could use this flaw to crash QEMU, resulting in a denial of service condition, or potentially execute code on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.",
