	"id": "CVE-2021-21429",
	"description": "OpenAPI Generator allows generation of API client libraries, server stubs, documentation and configuration automatically given an OpenAPI Spec. Using `File.createTempFile` in JDK will result in creating and using insecure temporary files that can leave application and system data vulnerable to attacks. OpenAPI Generator maven plug-in creates insecure temporary files during the process. The issue has been patched with `Files.createTempFile` and released in the v5.1.0 stable version.",
