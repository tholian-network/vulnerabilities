	"description": "A vulnerability in an API of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against users of the application web-based interface. This vulnerability exists because the API does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious input to the API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the web-based interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.",
