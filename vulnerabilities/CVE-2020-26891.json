	"id": "CVE-2020-26891",
	"description": "AuthRestServlet in Matrix Synapse before 1.21.0 is vulnerable to XSS due to unsafe interpolation of the session GET parameter. This allows a remote attacker to execute an XSS attack on the domain Synapse is hosted on, by supplying the victim user with a malicious URL to the /_matrix/client/r0/auth/*/fallback/web or /_matrix/client/unstable/auth/*/fallback/web Synapse endpoints.\n\nA security issue has been found in matrix-synapse before 1.21.0, where HTML pages served via Synapse were vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.",
