	"description": "A security issue has been found in TensorFlow before version 2.4.2. An attacker can trigger a null pointer dereference in the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.SparseFillEmptyRows`. This is because of missing validation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/fdc82089d206e281c628a93771336bf87863d5e8/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_fill_empty_rows_op.cc#L230-L231) that was covered under a `TODO`. If the `dense_shape` tensor is empty, then `dense_shape_t.vec<>()` would cause a null pointer dereference in the implementation of the op.",
