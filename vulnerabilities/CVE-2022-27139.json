	"id": "CVE-2022-27139",
	"description": "An arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the file upload module of Ghost v4.39.0 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted SVG file. NOTE: Vendor states that as outlined in Ghost's security documentation, upload of SVGs is only possible by trusted authenticated users. The uploading of SVG files to Ghost does not represent a remote code execution vulnerability. SVGs are not executable on the server, and may only execute javascript in a client's browser - this is expected and intentional functionality",
