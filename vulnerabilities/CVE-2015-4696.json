	"description": "Use-after-free vulnerability in libwmf 0.2.8.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted WMF file to the (1) wmf2gd or (2) wmf2eps command.\n\nIt was discovered that libwmf did not properly process certain WMF files. By tricking a victim into opening a specially crafted WMF file in an application using libwmf, a remote attacker could possibly exploit this flaw to cause a crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.",
