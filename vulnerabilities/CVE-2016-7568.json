	"id": "CVE-2016-7568",
	"description": "Integer overflow in the gdImageWebpCtx function in gd_webp.c in the GD Graphics Library (aka libgd) through 2.2.3, as used in PHP through 7.0.11, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted imagewebp and imagedestroy calls.\n\nAn integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was found in gd. A specially crafted image, when converted to webp, could cause the application to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code.",
