The vulnerabilities are located in the `query` and `id` parameters of the `wpjb-email`, `wpjb-job`, `wpjb-application`, and `wpjb-membership` modules. Remote attackers are able to inject malicious script code to hijack admin session credentials via the backend, or to manipulate the backend on client-side performed requests. The attack vector is non-persistent and the request method to inject is GET. The attacker does not need a privileged user account to perform a successful exploitation.",
