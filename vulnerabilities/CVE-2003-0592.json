	"description": "Konqueror in KDE 3.1.3 and earlier (kdelibs) allows remote attackers to bypass intended cookie access restrictions on a web application via \"%2e%2e\" (encoded dot dot) directory traversal sequences in a URL, which causes Konqueror to send the cookie outside the specified URL subsets, e.g. to a vulnerable application that runs on the same server as the target application.",
