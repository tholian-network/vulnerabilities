	"description": "An out of bounds read flaw was discovered in libssh2 before 1.8.1 in the way SFTP packets with empty payloads are parsed. A remote attacker who compromises a SSH server may be able to cause a Denial of Service or read data in the client memory.\n\nAn issue has been found in libssh2 before 1.8.1 where a server could send a specially crafted partial SFTP packet with a empty payload in response to various SFTP commands such as read directory, file status, status vfs and symlink. The result would be a memory out of bounds read.",
