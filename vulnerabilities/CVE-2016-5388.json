	"id": "CVE-2016-5388",
	"description": "It was discovered that tomcat used the value of the Proxy header from HTTP requests to initialize the HTTP_PROXY environment variable for CGI scripts, which in turn was incorrectly used by certain HTTP client implementations to configure the proxy for outgoing HTTP requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to redirect HTTP requests performed by a CGI script to an attacker-controlled proxy via a malicious HTTP request.",
