	"id": "CVE-2021-36460",
	"description": "VeryFitPro (com.veryfit2hr.second) 3.2.8 hashes the account's password locally on the device and uses the hash to authenticate in all communication with the backend API, including login, registration and changing of passwords. This allows an attacker in possession of a hash to takeover a user's account, rendering the benefits of storing hashed passwords in the database useless.",
