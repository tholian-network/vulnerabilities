	"id": "CVE-2020-8833",
	"description": "Time-of-check Time-of-use Race Condition vulnerability on crash report ownership change in Apport allows for a possible privilege escalation opportunity. If fs.protected_symlinks is disabled, this can be exploited between the os.open and os.chown calls when the Apport cron script clears out crash files of size 0. A symlink with the same name as the deleted file can then be created upon which chown will be called, changing the file owner to root. Fixed in versions 2.20.1-0ubuntu2.23, 2.20.9-0ubuntu7.14, 2.20.11-0ubuntu8.8 and 2.20.11-0ubuntu22.\n\nAffected: Canonical Apport < 2.20.1-0ubuntu2.23, < 2.20.9-0ubuntu7.14, < 2.20.11-0ubuntu8.8\n\nAffected: Canonical Apport 2.20.1-0ubuntu2.23, 2.20.9-0ubuntu7.14, 2.20.11-0ubuntu8.8, 2.20.11-0ubuntu22\n\nAffected: Canonical Apport 2.20.1-0ubuntu2.23, 2.20.9-0ubuntu7.14, 2.20.11-0ubuntu8.8, 2.20.11-0ubuntu22",
