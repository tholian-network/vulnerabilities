	"id": "CVE-2021-28117",
	"description": "libdiscover/backends/KNSBackend/KNSResource.cpp in KDE Discover before 5.21.3 automatically creates links to potentially dangerous URLs (that are neither https:// nor http://) based on the content of the store.kde.org web site. (5.18.7 is also a fixed version.)\n\nA security issue has been found in Discover version 5.21.2. Discover fetches the description and related texts of some applications/plugins from store.kde.org. That text is displayed to the user, after turning into a clickable link any part of the text that looks like a link. This is done for any kind of link, be it smb:// nfs:// etc. when in fact it only makes sense for http/https links. Opening links that the user has clicked on is not very problematic but can be used to chain to other attack vectors. Given the intended functionality of the feature is just for http/https links it makes sense to do that verification. The issue is fixed in Discover version 5.21.3.",
