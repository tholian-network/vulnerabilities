	"description": "A timing attack in SVG rendering in Google Chrome prior to 60.0.3112.78 for Linux, Windows, and Mac allowed a remote attacker to extract pixel values from a cross-origin page being iframe'd via a crafted HTML page.\n\nAn information leakage vulnerability has been found in the Chromium browser < 60.0.3112.78. By rendering a FeConvolveMatrix SVG filter over a target iframe and timing its execution an attacking page can extract pixel values from a cross-origin page being iframe'd. This also allows reading ones own origin for history sniffing.",
