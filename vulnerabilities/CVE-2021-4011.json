	"id": "CVE-2021-4011",
	"description": "A flaw was found in xorg-x11-server in versions before 21.1.2 and before 1.20.14. An out-of-bounds access can occur in the SwapCreateRegister function. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\nA security issue has been found in X.Org before version 21.1.2 and Xwayland before version 21.1.4. The handlers for the RecordCreateContext and RecordRegisterClients requests of the Record extension do not properly validate the request length leading to an out of bounds memory write. This can lead to local privileges elevation on systems where the X server is running privileged and remote code execution for SSH X forwarding sessions.",
