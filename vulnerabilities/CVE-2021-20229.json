{
	"id": "CVE-2021-20229",
	"description": "A security issue was found in  PostgreSQL 13 before version 13.2. A user having a SELECT privilege on an individual column can craft a special query that returns all columns of the table. Additionally, a stored view that uses column-level privileges will have incomplete column-usage bitmaps. In installations that depend on column-level permissions for security, it is recommended to execute CREATE OR REPLACE on all user-defined views to force them to be re-parsed.",
