	"description": "A flaw was found in the JFS filesystem code in the Linux Kernel which allows a local attacker with the ability to set extended attributes to panic the system, causing memory corruption or escalating privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.\n\nIn the Linux kernel up until 5.10.4, there is an array-index-out-of-bounds in fs/jfs/jfs_dmap.c in dbAdjTree and it may cause out of bounds reads and denial of service.",
