	"id": "CVE-2011-5182",
	"description": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in lanoba-social-plugin/index.php in the Lanoba Social plugin 1.0 for WordPress allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the action parameter.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, stating \"Lanoba's plug in does sanitize user input, and because that input is never sent to the browser, an attacker has no way of executing script or code on a user's behalf.",
