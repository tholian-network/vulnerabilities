	"description": "SLPJS (npm package slpjs) before version 0.27.2, has a vulnerability where users could experience false-negative validation outcomes for MINT transaction operations. A poorly implemented SLP wallet could allow spending of the affected tokens which would result in the destruction of a user's minting baton. This is fixed in version 0.27.2.",
