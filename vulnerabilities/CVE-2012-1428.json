	"id": "CVE-2012-1428",
	"description": "The TAR file parser in Quick Heal (aka Cat QuickHeal) 11.00, Norman Antivirus 6.06.12, and Sophos Anti-Virus 4.61.0 allows remote attackers to bypass malware detection via a POSIX TAR file with a \\4a\\46\\49\\46 character sequence at a certain location.  NOTE: this may later be SPLIT into multiple CVEs if additional information is published showing that the error occurred independently in different TAR parser implementations.",
