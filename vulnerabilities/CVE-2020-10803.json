	"description": "In phpMyAdmin 4.x before 4.9.5 and 5.x before 5.0.2, a SQL injection vulnerability was discovered where malicious code could be used to trigger an XSS attack through retrieving and displaying results (in tbl_get_field.php and libraries/classes/Display/Results.php). The attacker must be able to insert crafted data into certain database tables, which when retrieved (for instance, through the Browse tab) can trigger the XSS attack.",
