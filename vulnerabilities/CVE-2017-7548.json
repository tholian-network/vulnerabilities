	"description": "PostgreSQL versions before 9.4.13, 9.5.8 and 9.6.4 are vulnerable to authorization flaw allowing remote authenticated attackers with no privileges on a large object to overwrite the entire contents of the object, resulting in a denial of service.\n\nAn authorization flaw was found in the way PostgreSQL handled large objects. A remote authenticated attacker with no privileges on a large object could potentially use this flaw to overwrite the entire content of the object, thus resulting in denial of service.",
