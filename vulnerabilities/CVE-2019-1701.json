	"description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the WebVPN service of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the WebVPN portal of an affected device. The vulnerabilities exist because the software insufficiently validates user-supplied input on an affected device. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information. An attacker would need administrator privileges on the device to exploit these vulnerabilities.\n\nAffected: Cisco Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software  < 9.4.4.34, < 9.6.4.25, < 9.8.4, < 9.9.2.50, < 9.10.1.17\nAffected: Cisco Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software  < 6.2.3.12, < 6.3.0.3\n\nAffected: Cisco Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software 9.4.4.34, 9.6.4.25, 9.8.4, 9.9.2.50, 9.10.1.17\nAffected: Cisco Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software 6.2.3.12, 6.3.0.3\n\nAffected: Cisco Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software 9.4.4.34, 9.6.4.25, 9.8.4, 9.9.2.50, 9.10.1.17\nAffected: Cisco Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software 6.2.3.12, 6.3.0.3",
