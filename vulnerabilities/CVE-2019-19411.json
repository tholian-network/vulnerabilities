	"description": "USG9500 with versions of V500R001C30SPC100, V500R001C30SPC200, V500R001C30SPC600, V500R001C60SPC500, V500R005C00SPC100, V500R005C00SPC200 have an information leakage vulnerability. Due to improper processing of the initialization vector used in a specific encryption algorithm, an attacker who gains access to this cryptographic primitive may exploit this vulnerability to cause the value of the confidentiality associated with its use to be diminished.\n\nAffected: n/a USG9500 V500R001C30SPC100,V500R001C30SPC200,V500R001C30SPC600,V500R001C60SPC500,V500R005C00SPC100,V500R005C00SPC200",
