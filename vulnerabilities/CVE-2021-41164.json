	"description": "CKEditor4 is an open source WYSIWYG HTML editor. In affected versions a vulnerability has been discovered in the Advanced Content Filter (ACF) module and may affect all plugins used by CKEditor 4. The vulnerability allowed to inject malformed HTML bypassing content sanitization, which could result in executing JavaScript code. It affects all users using the CKEditor 4 at version < 4.17.0. The problem has been recognized and patched. The fix will be available in version 4.17.0.\n\nIn CKEditor4 before version 4.17.0, as used by Drupal before version 9.2.9, a vulnerability has been discovered in the Advanced Content Filter (ACF) module and may affect all plugins used by CKEditor 4. The vulnerability allowed to inject malformed HTML bypassing content sanitization, which could result in executing JavaScript code.\r\n\r\nIn Drupal, an attacker that can create or edit content (even without access to CKEditor themselves) may be able to exploit one or more Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities to target users with access to the WYSIWYG CKEditor, including site admins with privileged access.",
