	"description": "If a URL using the file: protocol is dragged and dropped onto an open tab of Firefox before 60.0 that is running in a different child process the tab will open a local file corresponding to the dropped URL, contrary to policy. One way to make the target tab open more reliably in a separate process is to open it with the noopener keyword.",
