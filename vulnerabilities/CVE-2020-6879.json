	"description": "Some ZTE devices have input verification vulnerabilities. The devices support configuring a static prefix through the web management page. The restriction of the front-end code can be bypassed by constructing a POST request message and sending the request to the creation of a static routing rule configuration interface. The WEB service backend fails to effectively verify the abnormal input. As a result, the attacker can successfully use the vulnerability to tamper parameter values. This affects: ZXHN Z500 V1.0.0.2B1.1000 and ZXHN F670L V1.1.10P1N2E. This is fixed in ZXHN Z500 V1.0.1.1B1.1000 and ZXHN F670L V1.1.10P2N2.",
