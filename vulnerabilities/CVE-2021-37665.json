{
	"id": "CVE-2021-37665",
	"description": "In TensorFlow before version 2.6.0 due to incomplete validation in MKL implementation of requantization, an attacker can trigger undefined behavior via binding a reference to a null pointer or can access data outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays. The implementation does not validate the dimensions of the input tensor. A similar issue occurs in MklRequantizePerChannelOp. The implementation does not perform full validation for all the input arguments and in the Github commit 203214568f5bc237603dbab6e1fd389f1572f5c9.",
