	"description": "XWiki is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. When using default XWiki configuration, it's possible for an attacker to upload an SVG containing a script executed when executing the download action on the file. This problem has been patched so that the default configuration doesn't allow to display the SVG files in the browser. Users are advised to update or to disallow uploads of SVG files.",
