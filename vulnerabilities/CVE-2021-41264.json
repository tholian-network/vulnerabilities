	"id": "CVE-2021-41264",
	"description": "OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development. In affected versions upgradeable contracts using `UUPSUpgradeable` may be vulnerable to an attack affecting uninitialized implementation contracts. A fix is included in version 4.3.2 of `@openzeppelin/contracts` and `@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable`. For users unable to upgrade; initialize implementation contracts using `UUPSUpgradeable` by invoking the initializer function (usually called `initialize`). An example is provided [in the forum](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/security-advisory-initialize-uups-implementation-contracts/15301).\n\nAffected: OpenZeppelin openzeppelin-contracts >= 4.1.0 < 4.3.2\n\nAffected: OpenZeppelin openzeppelin-contracts >= 4.1.0 < 4.3.2",
