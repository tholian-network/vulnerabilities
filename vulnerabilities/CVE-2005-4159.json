	"id": "CVE-2005-4159",
	"description": "NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the vendor and third parties. SQL injection vulnerability in Memberlist.php in Simple Machines Forum (SMF) 1.1 rc1 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the start parameter.  NOTE: the vendor says that since only one character can be modified, there is no SQL injection. Thus this might be an \"invalid SQL syntax error.\"  Multiple followups support the vendor",
