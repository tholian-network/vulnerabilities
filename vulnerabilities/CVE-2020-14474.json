	"id": "CVE-2020-14474",
	"description": "The Cellebrite UFED physical device 5.0 through 7.5.0.845 relies on key material hardcoded within both the executable code supporting the decryption process, and within the encrypted files themselves by using a key enveloping technique. The recovered key material is the same for every device running the same version of the software, and does not appear to be changed with each new build. It is possible to reconstruct the decryption process using the hardcoded key material and obtain easy access to otherwise protected data.",
