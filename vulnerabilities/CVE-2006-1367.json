	"description": "The Motorola PEBL U6 08.83.76R, the Motorola V600, and possibly the Motorola E398 and other Motorola P2K-based phones does not require pairing for a connection related to the Headset Audio Gateway service, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to obtain AT level access and view phonebook entries and saved SMS messages by connecting on Bluetooth channel 3 and tricking the user into pressing Grant, aka a \"Blueline\" attack.  NOTE: while user-assisted, the attack is made more feasible because of a GUI misrepresentation issue that allows a default message to be replaced by an attacker-specified one.",
