{
	"id": "CVE-2021-39293",
	"description": "In archive/zip in Go before 1.16.8 and 1.17.x before 1.17.1, a crafted archive header (falsely designating that many files are present) can cause a NewReader or OpenReader panic. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-33196.\n\nA security issue has been found in go before version 1.17.1. An oversight in the fix for CVE-2021-33196 still allows for an out of memory panic when the indicated directory size in the archive header is so large that subtracting it from the archive size overflows a uint64, effectively bypassing the check that the number of files in the archive is reasonable.",
