{
	"id": "CVE-2019-9149",
	"description": "Mailvelope prior to 3.3.0 allows private key operations without user interaction via its client-API. By modifying an URL parameter in Mailvelope, an attacker is able to sign (and encrypt) arbitrary messages with Mailvelope, assuming the private key password is cached. A second vulnerability allows an attacker to decrypt an arbitrary message when the GnuPG backend is used in Mailvelope.",
