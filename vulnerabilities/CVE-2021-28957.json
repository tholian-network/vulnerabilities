	"id": "CVE-2021-28957",
	"description": "An XSS vulnerability was discovered in python-lxml's clean module versions before 4.6.3. When disabling the safe_attrs_only and forms arguments, the Cleaner class does not remove the formaction attribute allowing for JS to bypass the sanitizer. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to run arbitrary JS code on users who interact with incorrectly sanitized HTML. This issue is patched in lxml 4.6.3.\n\npython-lxml 4.6.2 places the HTML action attribute into defs.link_attrs (in html/defs.py) for later use in input sanitization, but does not do the same for the HTML5 formaction attribute.",
