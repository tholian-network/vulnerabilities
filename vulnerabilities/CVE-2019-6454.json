	"id": "CVE-2019-6454",
	"description": "An issue was discovered in sd-bus in systemd 239. bus_process_object() in libsystemd/sd-bus/bus-objects.c allocates a variable-length stack buffer for temporarily storing the object path of incoming D-Bus messages. An unprivileged local user can exploit this by sending a specially crafted message to PID1, causing the stack pointer to jump over the stack guard pages into an unmapped memory region and trigger a denial of service (systemd PID1 crash and kernel panic).\n\nIt was found that bus_process_object() in bus-objects.c allocates a buffer on the stack large enough to temporarily store the object path specified in the incoming message. A malicious unprivileged local user to send a message which results in the stack pointer moving outside of the bounds of the currently mapped stack region, jumping over the stack guard pages. A specifically crafted DBUS message could crash PID 1 and result in a subsequent kernel panic.",
