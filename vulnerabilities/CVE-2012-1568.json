	"id": "CVE-2012-1568",
	"description": "The ExecShield feature in a certain Red Hat patch for the Linux kernel in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 and 6 and Fedora 15 and 16 does not properly handle use of many shared libraries by a 32-bit executable file, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism by leveraging a predictable base address for one of these libraries.",
