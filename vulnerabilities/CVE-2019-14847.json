{
	"id": "CVE-2019-14847",
	"description": "A denial of service has been found in Samba before 4.10.10, where users with the \"get changes\" extended access right can crash the AD DC LDAP server by requesting an attribute using the range= syntax.\r\nBy default, the supported versions of Samba impacted by this issue run using the \"standard\" process model, which is unaffected. This is controlled by the -M or --model parameter to the samba binary. Unsupported Samba versions before Samba 4.7 use a single process for the LDAP server, and so are impacted. Samba 4.8, 4.9 and 4.10 are impacted if -M prefork or -M single is used. To mitigate this issue, select -M standard (the default).",
