	"description": "Microsoft Internet Explorer before Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, when Prompt is configured in Security Settings, uses modal dialogs to verify that a user wishes to run an ActiveX control or perform other risky actions, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to construct a race condition that tricks a user into clicking an object or pressing keys that are actually applied to a \"Yes\" approval for executing the control.",
