	"description": "Grassroot Platform is an application to make it faster, cheaper and easier to persistently organize and mobilize people in low-income communities. Grassroot Platform before master deployment as of 2021-04-16 did not properly verify the signature of JSON Web Tokens when refreshing an existing JWT. This allows to forge a valid JWT. The problem has been patched in version 1.3.1 by deprecating the JWT refresh function, which was an overdue deprecation regardless (the \"refresh\" flow is no longer used).\n\nAffected: grassrootza grassroot-platform < 1.3.1",
