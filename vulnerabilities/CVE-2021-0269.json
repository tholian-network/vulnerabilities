	"id": "CVE-2021-0269",
	"description": "The improper handling of client-side parameters in J-Web of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker to perform a number of different malicious actions against a target device when a user is authenticated to J-Web. An attacker may be able to supersede existing parameters, including hardcoded parameters within the HTTP/S session, access and exploit variables, bypass web application firewall rules or input validation mechanisms, and otherwise alter and modify J-Web's normal behavior. An attacker may be able to transition victims to malicious web services, or exfiltrate sensitive information from otherwise secure web forms.
