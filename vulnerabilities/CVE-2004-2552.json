	"id": "CVE-2004-2552",
	"description": "Buffer overflow in XBoard 4.2.7 and earlier might allow local users to execute arbitrary code via a long -icshost command line argument. NOTE: since the program is not setuid and not normally called from remote programs, there may not be a typical attack vector for the issue that crosses privilege boundaries.  Therefore this may not be a vulnerability.",
