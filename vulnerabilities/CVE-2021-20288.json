{
	"id": "CVE-2021-20288",
	"description": "An authentication flaw was found in ceph before version 15.2.11. When the monitor handles CEPHX_GET_AUTH_SESSION_KEY requests, it doesn't sanitize other_keys, allowing key reuse. An attacker who can request a global_id can exploit the ability of any user to request a global_id previously associated with another user, as ceph does not force the reuse of old keys to generate new ones.",
