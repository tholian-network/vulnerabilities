	"description": "BIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected version and are configured to use GSS-TSIG features. In a configuration which uses BIND's default settings the vulnerable code path is not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting valid values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credentialconfiguration options. Although the default configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers. The most likely outcome of a successful exploitation of the vulnerability is a crash of the named process. However, remote code execution, while unproven, is theoretically possible. Affects: BIND 9.5.0 -> 9.11.27, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.11, and versions BIND 9.11.3-S1 -> 9.11.27-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 -> 9.16.11-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition. Also release versions 9.17.0 -> 9.17.1 of the BIND 9.17 development branch\n\nA security issue was found in BIND 9.5.0 up to 9.11.27, 9.12.0 up to 9.16.11, and versions BIND 9.11.3-S1 up to 9.11.27-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 up to 9.16.11-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition, as well as the release versions 9.17.0 and 9.17.1 of the BIND 9.17 development branch. A vulnerability in BIND's GSSAPI security policy can be targeted by a buffer overflow attack.",
