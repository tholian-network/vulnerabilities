	"id": "CVE-2017-3138",
	"description": "named contains a feature which allows operators to issue commands to a running server by communicating with the server process over a control channel, using a utility program such as rndc. A regression introduced in a recent feature change has created a situation under which some versions of named can be caused to exit with a REQUIRE assertion failure if they are sent a null command string. Affects BIND 9.9.9->9.9.9-P7, 9.9.10b1->9.9.10rc2, 9.10.4->9.10.4-P7, 9.10.5b1->9.10.5rc2, 9.11.0->9.11.0-P4, 9.11.1b1->9.11.1rc2, 9.9.9-S1->9.9.9-S9.\n\nA security issue has been found in the bind named daemon, that will exit with a \"require\" assertion failure if it receives a null command string on its control channel. The control channel is not enabled by default and is usually restricted to a few remote hosts via an ACL and/or a transaction key.",
