	"id": "CVE-2022-31046",
	"description": "TYPO3 is an open source web content management system. Prior to versions 7.6.57 ELTS, 8.7.47 ELTS, 9.5.34 ELTS, 10.4.29, and 11.5.11, the export functionality fails to limit the result set to allowed columns of a particular database table. This way, authenticated users can export internal details of database tables they already have access to. TYPO3 versions 7.6.57 ELTS, 8.7.47 ELTS, 9.5.34 ELTS, 10.4.29, 11.5.11 fix the problem described above. In order to address this issue, access to mentioned export functionality is completely denied for regular backend users.\n\nAffected: TYPO3 typo3 >= 7.0.0, < 7.6.57, >= 8.0.0, < 8.7.47, >= 9.0.0, < 9.5.34, >= 10.0.0, < 10.4.29, >= 11.0.0, < 11.5.11",
