	"description": "There's a flaw in src/lib/openjp2/pi.c of openjpeg in versions prior to 2.4.0. If an attacker is able to provide untrusted input to openjpeg's conversion/encoding functionality, they could cause an out-of-bounds read. The highest impact of this flaw is to application availability.\n\nAn out-of-bounds read was discovered in lib/openjp2/pi.c:312 in OpenJPEG before version 2.4.0.",
