	"description": "Integer signedness error in the fw_ioctl (FW_IOCTL) function in the FireWire (IEEE-1394) drivers (dev/firewire/fwdev.c) in various BSD kernels, including DragonFlyBSD, FreeBSD 5.5, MidnightBSD 0.1-CURRENT before 20061115, NetBSD-current before 20061116, NetBSD-4 before 20061203, and TrustedBSD, allows local users to read arbitrary memory contents via certain negative values of crom_buf->len in an FW_GCROM command. NOTE: this issue has been labeled as an integer overflow, but it is more like an integer signedness error.",
