{
	"id": "CVE-2018-3917",
	"description": "On Samsung SmartThings Hub STH-ETH-250 devices with firmware version 0.20.17, the video-core process insecurely extracts the fields from the \"shard\" table of its SQLite database, leading to a buffer overflow on the stack. An attacker can send an HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability. The strcpy call overflows the destination buffer, which has a size of 16 bytes. An attacker can send an arbitrarily long \"region\" value in order to exploit this vulnerability.",
