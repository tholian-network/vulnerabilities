	"description": "A vulnerability in the Stapler web framework used in Jenkins 2.185 and earlier, LTS 2.176.1 and earlier allowed attackers to access view fragments directly, bypassing permission checks and possibly obtain sensitive information.\n\nA security issue has been found in Jenkins before 2.186. Jenkins uses the Stapler web framework to render its UI views. These views are frequently comprised of several view fragments, enabling plugins to extend existing views with more content. In some cases attackers could directly access a view fragment containing sensitive information, bypassing any permission checks in the corresponding view.",
