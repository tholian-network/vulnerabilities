	"id": "CVE-2017-13723",
	"description": "In X.Org Server (aka xserver and xorg-server) before 1.19.4, a local attacker authenticated to the X server could overflow a global buffer, causing crashes of the X server or potentially other problems by injecting large or malformed XKB related atoms and accessing them via xkbcomp.\n\nA stack buffer overflow was found in xkbtext.c, which didn't handle xkb formatted string output safely due to a single shared static buffer. The fix introduces a ring of resizable buffers to avoid problems when strings end up longer than anticipated.\r\nThis vulnerability may potentially lead to privilege escalation when the xorg-server is running with root privileges.",
