	"description": "The Apple Java plugin, as used in Netscape 7.1 and 7.2, Mozilla 1.7.2, and Firefox 0.9.3 on MacOS X 10.3.5, when tabbed browsing is enabled, does not properly handle SetWindow(NULL) calls, which allows Java applets from one tab to draw to other tabs and facilitates phishing attacks that spoof tabs.",
