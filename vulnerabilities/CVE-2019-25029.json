	"id": "CVE-2019-25029",
	"description": "In Versa Director, the command injection is an attack in which the goal is execution of arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible when an application passes unsafe user supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers etc.) to a system shell. In this attack, the attacker-supplied operating system commands are usually executed with the privileges of the vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible largely due to insufficient input validation.\n\nAffected: n/a Versa Director Fixed Versions: 16.1R2S11, 20.2.2, 21.1.1, 21.2.1",
