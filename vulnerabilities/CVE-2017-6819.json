The CSRF can trigger an outbound HTTP request for a large file that is then parsed by Press This.\n\nA cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists on the Press This page of WordPress. This issue can be used to create a Denial of Service (DoS) condition if an authenticated administrator visits a malicious URL.",
