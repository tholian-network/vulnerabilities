	"description": "Microsoft Internet Explorer allows remote attackers to spoof a legitimate URL in the status bar and conduct a phishing attack via a web page with an anchor element with a legitimate \"href\" attribute, a form whose action points to a malicious URL, and an INPUT submit element that is modified to look like a legitimate URL.  NOTE: this issue is very similar to CVE-2004-1104, although the manipulations are slightly different.",
