	"id": "CVE-2017-7512",
	"description": "Red Hat 3scale (aka RH-3scale) API Management Platform (AMP) before 2.0.0 would permit creation of an access token without a client secret. An attacker could use this flaw to circumvent authentication controls and gain access to restricted APIs. NOTE: some sources have a typo in which CVE-2017-7512 maps to an OpenVPN vulnerability. The proper CVE ID for that OpenVPN vulnerability is CVE-2017-7521. Specifically, CVE-2017-7521 is the correct CVE ID for TWO closely related findings in OpenVPN. Any source that lists BOTH CVE-2017-7512 and CVE-2017-7521 for OpenVPN should have listed ONLY CVE-2017-7521.\n\nAffected: n/a 3scale AMP before 2.0.0 3scale AMP before 2.0.0\n\nA remote denial of service has been found in OpenVPN < 2.4.3. A remote client can exploit a memory leak in the server's certificate parsing code to make it leak a few bytes of memory for each connection attempt, causing it to run out of memory.",
