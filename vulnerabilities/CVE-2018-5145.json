	"description": "Memory safety bugs were reported in Firefox ESR 52.6. These bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 52.7 and Thunderbird < 52.7.\n\nVarious memory safety bugs have been found in Thunderbird < 52.7.0, some of them presenting evidence of memory corruption. Mozilla presumes that with enough effort some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.",
