	"description": "A flaw was found in qemu. A host privilege escalation issue was found in the virtio-fs shared file system daemon where a privileged guest user is able to create a device special file in the shared directory and use it to r/w access host devices.\n\nA potential host privilege escalation issue was found in the virtio-fs shared  file system daemon (virtiofsd) of the QEMU. Virtio-fs daemon shares the host directory tree with a guest VM. The said privilege escalation scenario may occur if a privileged guest user was to create device special file in the shared directory and use it to r/w access host devices. A privileged guest user may use this flaw to arbitrarily access (r/w) host files resulting in DoS scenario or may potentially escalate privileges on the host.",
