	"id": "CVE-2019-11043",
	"description": "In PHP versions 7.1.x below 7.1.33, 7.2.x below 7.2.24 and 7.3.x below 7.3.11 in certain configurations of FPM setup it is possible to cause FPM module to write past allocated buffers into the space reserved for FCGI protocol data, thus opening the possibility of remote code execution.\n\nA buffer underflow issue has been found in the php-fpm component of php before 7.3.11, 7.2.24 and 7.1.33, leading to remote code execution in certain nginx + php-fpm configurations. This vulnerability can be exploited if the fastcgi_split_path_info directive contains a regexp that can be broken by an attacker by supplying %0a in the path info which results in the fastcgi_param PATH_INFO being empty.",
