	"description": "epan/dissectors/packet-h225.c in the H.225 dissector in Wireshark 2.x before 2.0.6 calls snprintf with one of its input buffers as the output buffer, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (copy overlap and application crash) via a crafted packet.\n\nIt may be possible to make Wireshark crash via the H.225 dissector by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.",
