	"description": "IBM BigFix Platform 9.2.0 through 9.2.14 and 9.5 through 9.5.9 is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting attacks, caused by improper validation of user-supplied input. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to inject arbitrary HTTP headers and cause the server to return a split response, once the URL is clicked. This would allow the attacker to perform further attacks, such as Web cache poisoning or cross-site scripting, and possibly obtain sensitive information. IBM X-force ID: 140692.\n\nAffected: IBM BigFix Platform 9.5.9, 9.2.0, 9.2.14, 9.5.0\n\nAffected: IBM BigFix Platform 9.5.9, 9.2.0, 9.2.14, 9.5.0",
