{
	"id": "CVE-2017-7702",
	"description": "In Wireshark 2.2.0 to 2.2.5 and 2.0.0 to 2.0.11, the WBXML dissector could go into an infinite loop, triggered by packet injection or a malformed capture file. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-wbxml.c by adding length validation.\n\nA security issue has been found in the WBXML dissector of wireshark <= 2.2.7. It is possible to make Wireshark consume excessive CPU resources by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.",
