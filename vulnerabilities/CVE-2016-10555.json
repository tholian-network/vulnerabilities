	"id": "CVE-2016-10555",
	"description": "Since \"algorithm\" isn't enforced in jwt.decode()in jwt-simple 0.3.0 and earlier, a malicious user could choose what algorithm is sent sent to the server. If the server is expecting RSA but is sent HMAC-SHA with RSA's public key, the server will think the public key is actually an HMAC private key. This could be used to forge any data an attacker wants.\n\nAffected: HackerOne jwt-simple node module <=0.3.0",
