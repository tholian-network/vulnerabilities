	"id": "CVE-2020-5222",
	"description": "Opencast before 7.6 and 8.1 enables a remember-me cookie based on a hash created from the username, password, and an additional system key. This means that an attacker getting access to a remember-me token for one server can get access to all servers which allow log-in using the same credentials without ever needing the credentials. This problem is fixed in Opencast 7.6 and Opencast 8.1\n\nAffected: opencast opencast < 7.6, >= 8.0, < 8.1",
