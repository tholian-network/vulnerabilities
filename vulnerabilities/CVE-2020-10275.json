	"id": "CVE-2020-10275",
	"description": "The access tokens for the REST API are directly derived from the publicly available default credentials for the web interface. Given a USERNAME and a PASSWORD, the token string is generated directly with base64(USERNAME:sha256(PASSWORD)). An unauthorized attacker inside the network can use the default credentials to compute the token and interact with the REST API to exfiltrate, infiltrate or delete data.\n\nAffected: Mobile Industrial Robots A/S MiR100 v2.8.1.1 and before",
