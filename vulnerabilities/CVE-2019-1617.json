	"id": "CVE-2019-1617",
	"description": "A vulnerability in the Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) N-port Virtualization (NPV) protocol implementation in Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to an incorrect processing of FCoE packets when the fcoe-npv feature is uninstalled. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a stream of FCoE frames from an adjacent host to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause packet amplification to occur, resulting in the saturation of interfaces and a DoS condition. Nexus 9000 Series Switches in Standalone NX-OS Mode are affected running software versions prior to 7.0(3)I7(5) and 9.2(2).\n\nAffected: Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches in Standalone NX-OS Mode  < 7.0(3)I7(5), < 9.2(2)",
