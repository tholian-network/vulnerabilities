	"id": "CVE-2018-20482",
	"description": "GNU Tar through 1.30, when --sparse is used, mishandles file shrinkage during read access, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (infinite read loop in sparse_dump_region in sparse.c) by modifying a file that is supposed to be archived by a different user's process (e.g., a system backup running as root).\n\nA denial of service issue has been found in GNU Tar versions up to and including 1.30. When creating archives with the --sparse option, tar would loop endlessly if a sparse file had been truncated while being archived.",
