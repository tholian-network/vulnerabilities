	"description": "libESMTP through 1.0.6 mishandles domain copying into a fixed-size buffer in ntlm_build_type_2 in ntlm/ntlmstruct.c, as demonstrated by a stack-based buffer over-read.\n\nlibESMTP before version 1.1.0 mishandles domain copying into a fixed-size buffer in ntlm_build_type_2 in ntlm/ntlmstruct.c. During NTLM authentication, a sufficiently long domain, workstation or user name would overwrite the stack. Furthermore, nt_unicode() is called with an incorrect length argument, potentially causing it to read uninitialised memory or possibly a SIGSEGV or SIGBUS under the same circumstances.",
