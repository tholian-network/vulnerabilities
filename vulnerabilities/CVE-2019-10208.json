	"description": "A flaw was discovered in postgresql versions 9.4.x before 9.4.24, 9.5.x before 9.5.19, 9.6.x before 9.6.15, 10.x before 10.10 and 11.x before 11.5 where arbitrary SQL statements can be executed given a suitable SECURITY DEFINER function. An attacker, with EXECUTE permission on the function, can execute arbitrary SQL as the owner of the function.\n\nA security issue has been found in PostgreSQL < 11.5 where given a suitable SECURITY DEFINER function, an attacker can execute arbitrary SQL under the identity of the function owner. An attack requires EXECUTE permission on the function, which must itself contain a function call having inexact argument type match. For example, length('foo'::varchar) and length('foo') are inexact, while length('foo'::text) is exact. As part of exploiting this vulnerability, the attacker uses CREATE DOMAIN to create a type in a pg_temp schema. The attack pattern and fix are similar to that for CVE-2007-2138.",
