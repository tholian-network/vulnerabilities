	"id": "CVE-2004-2022",
	"description": "ActivePerl 5.8.x and others, and Larry Wall's Perl 5.6.1 and others, when running on Windows systems, allows attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long argument to the system command, which leads to a stack-based buffer overflow.  NOTE: it is unclear whether this bug is in Perl or the OS API that is used by Perl.",
