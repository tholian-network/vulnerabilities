	"description": "The URL percent-encoding decode function in libcurl before 7.51.0 is called `curl_easy_unescape`. Internally, even if this function would be made to allocate a unscape destination buffer larger than 2GB, it would return that new length in a signed 32 bit integer variable, thus the length would get either just truncated or both truncated and turned negative. That could then lead to libcurl writing outside of its heap based buffer.\n\nThe URL percent-encoding decode function in libcurl is called curl_easy_unescape.

That could then lead to libcurl writing outside of its heap based buffer.\n\nThis can be triggered by a user on a 64bit system if the user can send in a custom (very large) URL to a libcurl using program.",
