	"id": "CVE-2019-5102",
	"description": "An exploitable information leak vulnerability exists in the ustream-ssl library of OpenWrt, versions 18.06.4 and 15.05.1. When connecting to a remote server, the server's SSL certificate is checked but no action is taken when the certificate is invalid. An attacker could exploit this behavior by performing a man-in-the-middle attack, providing any certificate, leading to the theft of all the data sent by the client during the first request.\n\nAffected: n/a OpenWRT OpenWrt 18.06.4, via wget (uclient-fetch) OpenWrt 15.05.1, via wget (busybox)",
