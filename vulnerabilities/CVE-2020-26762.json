	"description": "A stack-based buffer-overflow exists in Edimax IP-Camera IC-3116W (v3.06) and IC-3140W (v3.07), which allows an unauthenticated, unauthorized attacker to perform remote-code-execution due to a crafted GET-Request. The overflow occurs in binary ipcam_cgi due to a missing type check in function doGetSysteminfo(). This has been fixed in version: IC-3116W v3.08.",
