This vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input in HTTP request parameters that describe filenames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using directory traversal techniques to submit a path to a desired file location. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view application files that may contain sensitive information.\n\nAffected: Cisco Cisco Prime Infrastructure  3.4\n\nAffected: Cisco Cisco Prime Infrastructure 3.4\n\nAffected: Cisco Cisco Prime Infrastructure 3.4",
