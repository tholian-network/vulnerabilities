	"id": "CVE-2020-10759",
	"description": "A PGP signature bypass flaw was found in fwupd (all versions), which could lead to the installation of unsigned firmware. As per upstream, a signature bypass is theoretically possible, but not practical because the Linux Vendor Firmware Service (LVFS) is either not implemented or enabled in versions of fwupd shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity.\n\nA PGP signature verification bypass has been found in fwupd prior to 1.4.0, and in libjcat <= 0.1.2. The issue is that if a detached signature is actually a PGP message, gpgme_op_verify() returns the rather perplexing GPG_ERR_NO_ERROR, and then gpgme_op_verify_result() builds an empty list.",
