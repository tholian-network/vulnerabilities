	"description": "Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 SP1 and possibly other versions allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code by instantiating COM objects as ActiveX controls, including (1) imskdic.dll (Microsoft IME), (2) chtskdic.dll (Microsoft IME), and (3) msoe.dll (Outlook), which leads to memory corruption. NOTE: it is not certain whether the issue is in Internet Explorer or the individual DLL files.",
