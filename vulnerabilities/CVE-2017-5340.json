	"id": "CVE-2017-5340",
	"description": "It was found that PHP uses uninitialized memory during calls to `unserialize()`. The payload supplied to `unserialize()` may control this uninitialized memory region and thus may be used to trick PHP into operating on faked objects and calling attacker controlled destructor function pointers, effectively allowing arbitrary code execution via specially crafted serialized data.",
