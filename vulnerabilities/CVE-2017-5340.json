	"id": "CVE-2017-5340",
	"description": "Zend/zend_hash.c in PHP before 7.0.15 and 7.1.x before 7.1.1 mishandles certain cases that require large array allocations, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (integer overflow, uninitialized memory access, and use of arbitrary destructor function pointers) via crafted serialized data.\n\nIt was found that PHP uses uninitialized memory during calls to `unserialize()`. The payload supplied to `unserialize()` may control this uninitialized memory region and thus may be used to trick PHP into operating on faked objects and calling attacker controlled destructor function pointers, effectively allowing arbitrary code execution via specially crafted serialized data.",
