	"description": "A security issue was found in mbsync in isync 1.4.0 before version 1.4.4. Due to an unchecked condition, a malicious or compromised IMAP server could use a crafted mail message that lacks headers (i.e., one that starts with an empty line) to provoke a heap overflow, which could conceivably be exploited for remote code execution.",
