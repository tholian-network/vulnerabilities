	"description": "Ruby through 2.4.7, 2.5.x through 2.5.6, and 2.6.x through 2.6.4 allows HTTP Response Splitting. If a program using WEBrick inserts untrusted input into the response header, an attacker can exploit it to insert a newline character to split a header, and inject malicious content to deceive clients. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2017-17742, which addressed the CRLF vector, but did not address an isolated CR or an isolated LF.\n\nIt has been discovered that Ruby before 2.4.8, 2.5.7 and 2.6.5 is vulnerable to HTTP response splitting in WEBrick bundled with Ruby. If a program using WEBrick inserts untrusted input into the response header, an attacker can exploit it to insert a newline character to split a header, and inject malicious content to deceive clients.\r\nThis is the same issue as CVE-2017-17742. The previous fix was incomplete, which addressed the CRLF vector, but did not address an isolated CR or an isolated LF.",
