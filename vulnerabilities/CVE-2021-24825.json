	"description": "The Custom Content Shortcode WordPress plugin before 4.0.2 does not validate the data passed to its load shortcode, which could allow Contributor+ (v < 4.0.1) or Admin+ (v < 4.0.2) users to display arbitrary files from the filesystem (such as logs, .htaccess etc), as well as perform Local File Inclusion attacks as PHP files will be executed. Please note that such attack is still possible by admin+ in single site blogs by default (but won't be when either the unfiltered_html or file_edit is disallowed)\n\nAffected: Unknown Custom Content Shortcode < 4.0.2\n\nAffected: Unknown Custom Content Shortcode 4.0.2\n\nAffected: Unknown Custom Content Shortcode 4.0.2",
