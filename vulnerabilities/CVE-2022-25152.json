	"description": "The ITarian platform (SAAS / on-premise) offers the possibility to run code on agents via a function called procedures. It is possible to require a mandatory approval process. Due to a vulnerability in the approval process, present in any version prior to 6.35.37347.20040, a malicious actor (with a valid session token) can create a procedure, bypass approval, and execute the procedure. This results in the ability for any user with a valid session token to perform arbitrary code execution and full system take-over on all agents.\n\nAffected: ITarian ITarian platform (SAAS / on-premise) < 6.35.37347.20040\n\nAffected: ITarian ITarian platform (SAAS / on-premise) any version\n\nAffected: ITarian ITarian platform (SAAS / on-premise) any version",
