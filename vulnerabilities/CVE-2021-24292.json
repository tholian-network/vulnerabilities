Although the element control lists a fixed set of possible html tags, it is possible to send a ‘save_builder’ request with the “heading_tag” set to “script”, and the actual “title” parameter set to JavaScript to be executed within the script tags added by the “heading_tag” parameter.\n\nAffected: weDevs Happy Addons for Elementor < 2.24.0\nAffected: weDevs Happy Addons Pro for Elementor < 1.17.0",
