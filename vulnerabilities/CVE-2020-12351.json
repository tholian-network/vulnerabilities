	"id": "CVE-2020-12351",
	"description": "Improper input validation in BlueZ may allow an unauthenticated user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via adjacent access.\n\nA flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel Bluetooth implementation handled L2CAP packets with A2MP CID. A remote attacker in adjacent range could use this flaw to crash the system causing denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code on the system by sending a specially crafted L2CAP packet. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.",
