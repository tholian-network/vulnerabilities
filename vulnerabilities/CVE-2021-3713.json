	"id": "CVE-2021-3713",
	"description": "An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the UAS (USB Attached SCSI) device emulation of QEMU in versions prior to 6.2.0-rc0. The device uses the guest supplied stream number unchecked, which can lead to out-of-bounds access to the UASDevice->data3 and UASDevice->status3 fields. A malicious guest user could use this flaw to crash QEMU or potentially achieve code execution with the privileges of the QEMU process on the host.\n\nAn out-of-bounds write issue was found in the UAS (USB Attached SCSI) device emulation of QEMU. It occurs due to missing sanity checks in the usb_uas_handle_data() function in hw/usb/dev-uas.c. In particular, the device uses the guest-supplied stream number unchecked, which can lead to guest-triggered out-of-bounds access to the UASDevice->data3 and UASDevice->status3 fields.",
