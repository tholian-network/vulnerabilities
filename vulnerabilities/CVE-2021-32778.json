	"id": "CVE-2021-32778",
	"description": "Envoy is an open source L7 proxy and communication bus designed for large modern service oriented architectures. In affected versions envoyâ€™s procedure for resetting a HTTP/2 stream has O(N^2) complexity, leading to high CPU utilization when a large number of streams are reset. Deployments are susceptible to Denial of Service when Envoy is configured with high limit on H/2 concurrent streams. An attacker wishing to exploit this vulnerability would require a client opening and closing a large number of H/2 streams. Envoy versions 1.19.1, 1.18.4, 1.17.4, 1.16.5 contain fixes to reduce time complexity of resetting HTTP/2 streams. As a workaround users may limit the number of simultaneous HTTP/2 dreams for upstream and downstream peers to a low number, i.e. 100.\n\nAffected: envoyproxy envoy >= 1.19.0, < 1.19.1, >= 1.18.0, < 1.18.4, >= 1.17.0, < 1.17.4, >= 1.16.0, < 1.16.5\n\nEnvoy, as used by Istio before version 1.11.1, contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability where an Envoy client opening and then resetting a large number of HTTP/2 requests could lead to excessive CPU consumption.",
