	"description": "A denial of service vulnerability was discovered in Samba's LDAP server before versions 4.7.12, 4.8.7, and 4.9.3. A CNAME loop could lead to infinite recursion in the server. An unprivileged local attacker could create such an entry, leading to denial of service.\n\nA denial of service security issue has been found in samba from 4.0.0 up to and including 4.9.2, where an unprivileged user can use the ldbadd tool to add DNS records to create a CNAME loop, causing infinite query recursion.",
