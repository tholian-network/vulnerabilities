	"description": "In app/Controller/ServersController.php in MISP 2.4.87, a server setting permitted the override of a path variable on certain Red Hed Enterprise Linux and CentOS systems (where rh_shell_fix was enabled), and consequently allowed site admins to inject arbitrary OS commands. The impact is limited by the setting being only accessible to the site administrator.",
