	"description": "In RDoc 3.11 through 6.x before 6.3.1, as distributed with Ruby through 3.0.1, it is possible to execute arbitrary code via | and tags in a filename.\n\nRDoc before version 6.3.1, as bundled with Ruby before version 2.7.4 and 2.6.8 as well as GitLab before version 14.0.2, used to call Kernel#open to open a local file. If a Ruby project has a file whose name starts with \"|\" and ends with \"tags\", the command following the pipe character is executed. A malicious Ruby project could exploit it to run an arbitrary command execution against a user who attempts to run the rdoc command.",
