	"description": "Buffer overflow in OPC UA applications allows remote attackers to trigger a stack overflow with carefully structured requests.\n\nA flaw has been discovered in wireshark >= 2.6.0 and < 2.6.4 in the  OpcUa dissector where a specially crafted structured request could lead to stack overflow. This could be used by an attacker to crash wireshark or execute arbitrary code on the affected host by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.",
