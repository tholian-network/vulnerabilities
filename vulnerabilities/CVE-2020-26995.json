	"description": "A vulnerability has been identified in JT2Go (All versions < V13.1.0), Teamcenter Visualization (All versions < V13.1.0). Affected applications lack proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing of SGI and RGB files. This could result in an out of bounds write past the end of an allocated structure. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.
