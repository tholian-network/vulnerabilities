{
	"id": "CVE-2008-4832",
	"description": "rc.sysinit in initscripts 8.12-8.21 and 8.56.15-0.1 on rPath allows local users to delete arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a directory under (1) /var/lock or (2) /var/run.  NOTE: this issue exists because of a race condition in an incorrect fix for CVE-2008-3524. NOTE: exploitation may require an unusual scenario in which rc.sysinit is executed other than at boot time.",
