{
	"id": "CVE-2021-37668",
	"description": "In TensorFlow before version 2.6.0 an attacker can cause denial of service in applications serving models using tf.raw_ops.UnravelIndex by triggering a division by 0. The implementation does not check that the tensor subsumed by dims is not empty. Hence, if one element of dims is 0, the implementation does a division by 0.",
