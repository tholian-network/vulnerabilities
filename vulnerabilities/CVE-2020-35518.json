	"description": "When binding against a DN during authentication, the reply from 389-ds-base will be different whether the DN exists or not. This can be used by an unauthenticated attacker to check the existence of an entry in the LDAP database.\n\nA security issue was found in 389-ds-base starting from version 1.4.2.3. When binding against a DN during authentication, the reply from 389-ds-base will be different whether the DN exists or not.
