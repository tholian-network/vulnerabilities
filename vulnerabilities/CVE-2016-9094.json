	"id": "CVE-2016-9094",
	"description": "Symantec Endpoint Protection clients place detected malware in quarantine as part of the intended product functionality. The quarantine logs can be exported for review by the user in a variety of formats including .CSV files. Prior to 14.0 MP1 and 12.1 RU6 MP7, the potential exists for file metadata to be interpreted and evaluated as a formula. Successful exploitation of an attack of this type requires considerable direct user-interaction from the user exporting and then opening the log files on the intended target client.\n\nAffected: Symantec Corporation Endpoint Protection Prior to SEP 14.0 MP1 & SEP 12.1 RU6 MP7",
