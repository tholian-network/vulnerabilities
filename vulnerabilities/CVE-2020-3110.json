	"id": "CVE-2020-3110",
	"description": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol implementation for the Cisco Video Surveillance 8000 Series IP Cameras could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute code remotely or cause a reload of an affected IP Camera. The vulnerability is due to missing checks when processing Cisco Discovery Protocol messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to the targeted IP Camera. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to expose the affected IP Camera for remote code execution or cause it to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. Cisco Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent). This vulnerability is fixed in Video Surveillance 8000 Series IP Camera Firmware Release 1.0.7 and later.\n\nAffected: Cisco Cisco Video Surveillance 8000 Series IP Cameras  < 1.0.7",
