	"id": "CVE-2006-7141",
	"description": "Absolute path traversal vulnerability in Oracle Database Server, when utl_file_dir is set to a wildcard value or \"CREATE ANY DIRECTORY to PUBLIC\" privileges exist, allows remote authenticated users to read and modify arbitrary files via full filepaths to utl_file functions such as (1) utl_file.put_line and (2) utl_file.get_line, a related issue to CVE-2005-0701.  NOTE: this issue is disputed by third parties who state that this is due to an insecure configuration instead of an inherent vulnerability",
