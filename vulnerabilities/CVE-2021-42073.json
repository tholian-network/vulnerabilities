	"id": "CVE-2021-42073",
	"description": "An issue was discovered in Barrier before 2.4.0. An attacker can enter an active session state with the barriers component (aka the server-side implementation of Barrier) simply by supplying a client label that identifies a valid client configuration. This label is \"Unnamed\" by default but could instead be guessed from hostnames or other publicly available information. In the active session state, an attacker can capture input device events from the server, and also modify the clipboard content on the server.\n\nA security issue has been found in Barrier before version 2.4.0. Knowing a valid client name allows information leaks and server manipulation. By default, newly added clients in the barrier GUI application on the server side get assigned the name \"Unnamed\". When an attacker knows a valid client name then it can specify this name in its Hello message and will be able to enter a fully active session state. In this state the client can receive input device events from the server, claim the clipboard or even inject arbitrary new clipboard content on the server.",
