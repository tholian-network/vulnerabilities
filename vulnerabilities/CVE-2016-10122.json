{
	"id": "CVE-2016-10122",
	"description": "A vulnerability has been found in firejail where the --x11 flag runs an X server as root and the --env flag could be used to set arbitrary environment variables. This skips runtime linker protections, for example LD_* variables for setuid executables. Therefore a non-privileged user could pop a root shell via hooking calls to getenv(3) in xauth(1).",
