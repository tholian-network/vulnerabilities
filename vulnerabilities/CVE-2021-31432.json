	"id": "CVE-2021-31432",
	"description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Parallels Desktop 15.1.5-47309. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the IDE virtual device. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the hypervisor. Was ZDI-CAN-13190.\n\nAffected: Parallels Desktop 15.1.5-47309\n\nAffected: Parallels Desktop <= 47309\n\nAffected: Parallels Desktop <= 47309",
