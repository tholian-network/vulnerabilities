	"id": "CVE-2019-13450",
	"description": "In the Zoom Client through 4.4.4 and RingCentral 7.0.136380.0312 on macOS, remote attackers can force a user to join a video call with the video camera active. This occurs because any web site can interact with the Zoom web server on localhost port 19421 or 19424. NOTE: a machine remains vulnerable if the Zoom Client was installed in the past and then uninstalled. Blocking exploitation requires additional steps, such as the ZDisableVideo preference and/or killing the web server, deleting the ~/.zoomus directory, and creating a ~/.zoomus plain file.",
