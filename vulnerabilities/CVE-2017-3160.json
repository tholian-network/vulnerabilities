	"id": "CVE-2017-3160",
	"description": "After the Android platform is added to Cordova the first time, or after a project is created using the build scripts, the scripts will fetch Gradle on the first build. However, since the default URI is not using https, it is vulnerable to a MiTM and the Gradle executable is not safe. The severity of this issue is high due to the fact that the build scripts immediately start a build after Gradle has been fetched. Developers who are concerned about this issue should install version 6.1.2 or higher of Cordova-Android. If developers are unable to install the latest version, this vulnerability can easily be mitigated by setting the CORDOVA_ANDROID_GRADLE_DISTRIBUTION_URL environment variable to https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.14.1-all.zip\n\nAffected: Apache Software Foundation Apache Cordova Android Apache Cordova 6.1.0 and below\n\nAffected: Apache Software Foundation Apache Cordova Android Apache Cordova 6.1.0 and below",
