	"description": "Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox and Thunderbird 68.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.6, Firefox < 74, Firefox < ESR68.6, and Firefox ESR < 68.6.\n\nSeveral memory safety and script safety bugs have been found in Firefox before 74, Firefox ESR before 68.6 and Thunderbird before 68.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption or escalation of privilege and Mozilla presumes that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.",
