	"id": "CVE-2022-23822",
	"description": "In this physical attack, an attacker may potentially exploit the Zynq-7000 SoC First Stage Boot Loader (FSBL) by bypassing authentication and loading a malicious image onto the device. This in turn may further allow the attacker to perform additional attacks such as such as using the device as a decryption oracle. An anticipated mitigation via a 2022.1 patch will resolve the issue.\n\nAffected: AMD-Xilinx Zynq-7000 SoC FSBL <= 2022.1\n\nAffected: AMD-Xilinx Zynq-7000 SoC FSBL 2022.1\n\nAffected: AMD-Xilinx Zynq-7000 SoC FSBL 2022.1",
