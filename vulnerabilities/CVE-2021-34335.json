	"id": "CVE-2021-34335",
	"description": "A floating point exception (FPE) due to an integer divide by zero was found in Exiv2 versions 0.27.4 and earlier. The FPE is triggered when Exiv2 is used to print the metadata of a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file.\n\nNote that this bug is only triggered when printing the interpreted (translated) data, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation that requires an extra command line option (`-p t` or `-P t`).",
