	"description": "LineageOS 16.0 and earlier is affected by: Incorrect Access Control. The impact is: The property checked by `adb root` can also be set in a normal adb shell session. The component is: adb shell (patches to fix this are at https://review.lineageos.org/c/LineageOS/android_system_core/+/234800, https://review.lineageos.org/c/LineageOS/android_device_lineage_sepolicy/+/234799).
