	"description": "A UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following vulnerability in arpwatch of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11-SP4-LTSS, SUSE Manager Server 4.0, SUSE OpenStack Cloud Crowbar 9; openSUSE Factory, Leap 15.2 allows local attackers with control of the runtime user to run arpwatch as to escalate to root upon the next restart of arpwatch. This issue affects: SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11-SP4-LTSS arpwatch versions prior to 2.1a15. SUSE Manager Server 4.0 arpwatch versions prior to 2.1a15. SUSE OpenStack Cloud Crowbar 9 arpwatch versions prior to 2.1a15. openSUSE Factory arpwatch version 2.1a15-169.5 and prior versions. openSUSE Leap 15.2 arpwatch version 2.1a15-lp152.5.5 and prior versions.\n\nAffected: SUSE SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11-SP4-LTSS < 2.1a15\nAffected: SUSE SUSE Manager Server 4.0 < 2.1a15\nAffected: SUSE SUSE OpenStack Cloud Crowbar 9 < 2.1a15\nAffected: openSUSE Factory <= 2.1a15-169.5\nAffected: openSUSE Leap 15.2 <= 2.1a15-lp152.5.5\n\nA security issue has been found in arpwatch as packaged by SUSE. /var/lib/arpwatch is packaged as root:root. Once arpwatch was run with a unprivileged user the ownership is changed to the unprivileged user, which allows the user specified to escalate to root the next time arpwatch is started. This is due to a SUSE-specific patch, upstream is not affected.\n\nAffected: SUSE SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11-SP4-LTSS 2.1a15\nAffected: SUSE SUSE Manager Server 4.0 2.1a15\nAffected: SUSE SUSE OpenStack Cloud Crowbar 9 2.1a15\nAffected: openSUSE Factory 2.1a15-169.5\nAffected: openSUSE Leap 15.2 2.1a15-lp152.5.5\n\nAffected: SUSE SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11-SP4-LTSS 2.1a15\nAffected: SUSE SUSE Manager Server 4.0 2.1a15\nAffected: SUSE SUSE OpenStack Cloud Crowbar 9 2.1a15\nAffected: openSUSE Factory 2.1a15-169.5\nAffected: openSUSE Leap 15.2 2.1a15-lp152.5.5",
