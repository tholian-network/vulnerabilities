{
	"id": "CVE-2019-17498",
	"description": "In libssh2 v1.9.0 and earlier versions, the SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT logic in packet.c has an integer overflow in a bounds check, enabling an attacker to specify an arbitrary (out-of-bounds) offset for a subsequent memory read. A crafted SSH server may be able to disclose sensitive information or cause a denial of service condition on the client system when a user connects to the server.\n\nAn out-of-bounds read has been found in libssh2 <= 1.9.0, when libssh2 is used to connect to a malicious server, leading to denial of service or information disclosure.",
