	"description": "An out of bounds read flaw was discovered in libssh2 before 1.8.1 in the way SSH packets with a padding length value greater than the packet length are parsed. A remote attacker who compromises a SSH server may be able to cause a Denial of Service or read data in the client memory.\n\nAn issue has been found in libssh2 before 1.8.1 where a server could send a specially crafted SSH packet with a padding length value greater than the packet length. This would result in a buffer read out of bounds when decompressing the packet or result in a corrupted packet value.",
