{
	"id": "CVE-2021-37641",
	"description": "In TensorFlow before version 2.6.0 if the arguments to tf.raw_ops.RaggedGather don't determine a valid ragged tensor code can trigger a read from outside of bounds of heap allocated buffers. The implementation directly reads the first dimension of a tensor shape before checking that said tensor has rank of at least 1 (i.e., it is not a scalar). Furthermore, the implementation does not check that the list given by params_nested_splits is not an empty list of tensors.",
