	"description": "WordPress before 1.5.2 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a direct request to (1) wp-includes/vars.php, (2) wp-content/plugins/hello.php, (3) wp-admin/upgrade-functions.php, (4) wp-admin/edit-form.php, (5) wp-settings.php, and (6) wp-admin/edit-form-comment.php, which leaks the path in an error message related to undefined functions or failed includes.  NOTE: the wp-admin/menu-header.php vector is already covered by CVE-2005-2110. NOTE: the vars.php, edit-form.php, wp-settings.php, and edit-form-comment.php vectors were also reported to affect WordPress 2.0.1.",
