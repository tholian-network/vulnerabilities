	"id": "CVE-2021-24555",
	"description": "The daac_delete_booking_callback function, hooked to the daac_delete_booking AJAX action, takes the id POST parameter which is passed into the SQL statement without proper sanitisation, validation or escaping, leading to a SQL Injection issue. Furthermore, the ajax action is lacking any CSRF and capability check, making it available to any authenticated user.\n\nAffected: Unknown Diary & Availability Calendar <= 1.0.3\n\nAffected: Unknown Diary & Availability Calendar 1.0.3\n\nAffected: Unknown Diary & Availability Calendar 1.0.3",
