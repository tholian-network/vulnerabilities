	"id": "CVE-2020-8794",
	"description": "OpenSMTPD before 6.6.4 allows remote code execution because of an out-of-bounds read in mta_io in mta_session.c for multi-line replies. Although this vulnerability affects the client side of OpenSMTPD, it is possible to attack a server because the server code launches the client code during bounce handling.\n\nAn out-of-bounds read vulnerability has been found in the client-side code of OpenSMTPD <= 6.6.3p1, leading to arbitrary command execution via a crafted SMTP transaction.",
