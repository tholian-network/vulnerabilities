It could occur in hw/scsi/scsi-disk.c:mode_sense_page() while processing MODE SELECT commands if 'page' was set to MODE_PAGE_ALLS (0x3f). Specifically, 'page' was used to index the stack-allocated 'mode_sense_valid' buffer (size=0x3f), causing an off-by-one error when trying to access the last element. A malicious guest could use this flaw to potentially crash QEMU, resulting in a denial of service condition.",
