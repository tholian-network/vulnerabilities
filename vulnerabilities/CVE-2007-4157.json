{
	"id": "CVE-2007-4157",
	"description": "PHPBlogger stores sensitive information under the web root with insufficient access control, which allows remote attackers to download a database containing an admin password hash via a direct request for data/pref.db.  NOTE: this can be easily leveraged for administrative access because composing the authentication cookie only requires the password hash, not the cleartext version.",
