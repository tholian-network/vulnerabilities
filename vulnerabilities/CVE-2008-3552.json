	"id": "CVE-2008-3552",
	"description": "Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Nokia Series 40 3rd edition FP1, and possibly later devices, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unknown vectors, probably related to MIDP privilege escalation and persistent MIDlets, aka \"ISSUES 11-15.\" NOTE: as of 20080807, the only disclosure is a vague pre-advisory with no actionable information.  However, because it is from a company led by a well-known researcher, it is being assigned a CVE identifier for tracking purposes.",
