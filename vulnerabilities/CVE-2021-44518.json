{
	"id": "CVE-2021-44518",
	"description": "An issue was discovered in the eGeeTouch 3rd Generation Travel Padlock application for Android. The lock sends a pairing code before each operation (lock or unlock) activated via the companion app. The code is sent unencrypted, allowing any attacker with the same app (either Android or iOS) to add the lock and take complete control. For successful exploitation, the attacker must be able to touch the lock's power button, and must be able to capture BLE network communication.",
