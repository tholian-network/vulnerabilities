	"id": "CVE-2021-29561",
	"description": "A security issue has been found in TensorFlow before version 2.4.2. An attacker can cause a denial of service by exploiting a `CHECK`-failure coming from `tf.raw_ops.LoadAndRemapMatrix`. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/d94227d43aa125ad8b54115c03cece54f6a1977b/tensorflow/core/kernels/ragged_tensor_to_tensor_op.cc#L219-L222) assumes that the `ckpt_path` is always a valid scalar. However, an attacker can send any other tensor as the first argument of `LoadAndRemapMatrix`. This would cause the rank `CHECK` in `scalar<T>()()` to trigger and terminate the process.",
