This mode is not the default mode, but can be enabled by users who want to disable LibreOffice's ability to include remote resources within a document. A flaw existed where remote graphic links loaded from docx documents were omitted from this protection prior to version 6.4.4. This issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice versions prior to 6.4.4.",
