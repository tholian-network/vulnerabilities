	"description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability in the dhcp6 client of systemd allows a malicious dhcp6 server to overwrite heap memory in systemd-networkd. Affected releases are systemd: versions up to and including 239.\n\nAffected: systemd systemd <= 239\n\nAn out-of-bounds write has been found in the dhcpv6 option handing code of systemd-networkd up to and including v239.\r\n\r\nIt was discovered that systemd-network does not correctly keep track of a buffer size  in the dhcp6_option_append_ia() function, when constructing DHCPv6 packets. This flaw may lead to an integer underflow that can be used to produce an heap-based buffer overflow. A malicious host on the same network segment as the victim's one may advertise itself as a DHCPv6 server and exploit this flaw to cause a Denial of Service or potentially gain code execution on the victim's machine. The overflow can be triggered relatively easy by advertising a DHCPv6 server with a server-id >= 493 characters long.",
