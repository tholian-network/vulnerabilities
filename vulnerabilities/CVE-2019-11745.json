	"description": "When encrypting with a block cipher, if a call to NSC_EncryptUpdate was made with data smaller than the block size, a small out of bounds write could occur. This could have caused heap corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.3, Firefox ESR < 68.3, and Firefox < 71.\n\nAn out-of-bounds write vulnerability has been found in the NSS component of Firefox before 71.0 and Thunderbird before 68.3. When encrypting with a block cipher, if a call to NSC_EncryptUpdate was made with data smaller than the block size, a small out of bounds write could occur. This could have caused heap corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.",
