	"description": "Postfix before 2.11.10, 3.0.x before 3.0.10, 3.1.x before 3.1.6, and 3.2.x before 3.2.2 might allow local users to gain privileges by leveraging undocumented functionality in Berkeley DB 2.x and later, related to reading settings from DB_CONFIG in the current directory.\n\nIt was found that Berkeley DB reads the DB_CONFIG configuration file from the current working directory by default. This happens when calling db_create() with dbenv=NULL; or using the dbm_open() function. This behavior leads to a security vulnerability because in the case of setuid or setgid commands, excerpts of the file are revealed to the calling user (and maybe more harm could be done with specially crafted DB_CONFIG files).",
