	"id": "CVE-2020-4077",
	"description": "In Electron before versions 7.2.4, 8.2.4, and 9.0.0-beta21, there is a context isolation bypass. Code running in the main world context in the renderer can reach into the isolated Electron context and perform privileged actions. Apps using both `contextIsolation` and `contextBridge` are affected. This is fixed in versions 9.0.0-beta.21, 8.2.4 and 7.2.4.\n\nAffected: electron electron >= 9.0.0-beta.0, <= 9.0.0-beta.20, >= 8.0.0, < 8.2.4, < 7.2.4\n\nAffected: electron electron >= 9.0.0-beta.0, <= 9.0.0-beta.20, >= 8.0.0, < 8.2.4, < 7.2.4",
