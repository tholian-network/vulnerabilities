	"description": "An issue was discovered in Prosody before 0.11.9. It does not use a constant-time algorithm for comparing certain secret strings when running under Lua 5.2 or later. This can potentially be used in a timing attack to reveal the contents of secret strings to an attacker.\n\nA security issue was found in the Prosody.im XMPP server software before version 0.11.9. It was discovered that Prosody does not use a constant-time algorithm for comparing certain secret strings when running under Lua 5.2 or later. This can potentially be used in a timing attack to reveal the contents of secret strings to an attacker.",
