{
	"id": "CVE-2019-25025",
	"description": "The activerecord-session_store (aka Active Record Session Store) component through 1.1.3 for Ruby on Rails does not use a constant-time approach when delivering information about whether a guessed session ID is valid. Consequently, remote attackers can leverage timing discrepancies to achieve a correct guess in a relatively short amount of time. This is a related issue to CVE-2019-16782.",
