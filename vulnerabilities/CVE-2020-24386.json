	"description": "An issue was discovered in Dovecot before 2.3.13. By using IMAP IDLE, an authenticated attacker can trigger unhibernation via attacker-controlled parameters, leading to access to other users' email messages (and path disclosure).\n\nA security issue was discovered in dovecot version 2.2.26 up to 2.3.11.3. When imap hibernation is active, an attacker can cause dovecot to discover the file system directory structure and access other users' emails using a specially crafted command. The attacker must have valid credentials to access the mail server. The issue is fixed in dovecot version 2.3.13.",
