	"description": "In Wireshark 2.2.0 to 2.2.6, the ROS dissector could crash with a NULL pointer dereference. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/asn1/ros/packet-ros-template.c by validating an OID.\n\nAn issue has been found in the ROS dissector of Wireshark < 2.2.7, where an NULL pointer dereference can be triggered by injecting a malicious packet into the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.",
