	"description": "Norton Utilities (prior to 16.0.3.44) may be susceptible to a DLL Preloading vulnerability, which is a type of issue that can occur when an application looks to call a DLL for execution and an attacker provides a malicious DLL to use instead. Depending on how the application is configured, it will generally follow a specific search path to locate the DLL. The vulnerability can be exploited by a simple file write (or potentially an over-write) which results in a foreign DLL running under the context of the application.\n\nAffected: Symantec Corporation Norton Utilities Prior to 16.0.3.44\n\nAffected: Symantec Corporation Norton Utilities < 16.0.3.44\n\nAffected: Symantec Corporation Norton Utilities < 16.0.3.44",
