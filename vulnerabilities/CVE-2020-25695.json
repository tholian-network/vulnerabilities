	"description": "A flaw was found in PostgreSQL versions before 13.1, before 12.5, before 11.10, before 10.15, before 9.6.20 and before 9.5.24. An attacker having permission to create non-temporary objects in at least one schema can execute arbitrary SQL functions under the identity of a superuser. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\nA security issue has been found in PostgreSQL before 12.5, where an attacker having permission to create non-temporary objects in at least one schema can execute arbitrary SQL functions under the identity of a superuser.\r\nWhile promptly updating PostgreSQL is the best remediation for most users, a user unable to do that can work around the vulnerability by disabling autovacuum and not manually running ANALYZE, CLUSTER, REINDEX, CREATE INDEX, VACUUM FULL, REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW, or a restore from output of the pg_dump command. Performance may degrade quickly under this workaround. VACUUM without the FULL option is safe, and all commands are fine when a trusted user owns the target object.",
