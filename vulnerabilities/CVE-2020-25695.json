	"id": "CVE-2020-25695",
	"description": "A security issue has been found in PostgreSQL before 12.5, where an attacker having permission to create non-temporary objects in at least one schema can execute arbitrary SQL functions under the identity of a superuser.\r\nWhile promptly updating PostgreSQL is the best remediation for most users, a user unable to do that can work around the vulnerability by disabling autovacuum and not manually running ANALYZE, CLUSTER, REINDEX, CREATE INDEX, VACUUM FULL, REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW, or a restore from output of the pg_dump command. Performance may degrade quickly under this workaround. VACUUM without the FULL option is safe, and all commands are fine when a trusted user owns the target object.",
