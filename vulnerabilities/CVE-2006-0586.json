	"description": "Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Oracle 10g Release 1 before CPU Jan 2006 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via multiple parameters in (1) ATTACH_JOB, (2) HAS_PRIVS, and (3) OPEN_JOB functions in the SYS.KUPV$FT package; and (4) UPDATE_JOB, (5) ACTIVE_JOB, (6) ATTACH_POSSIBLE, (7) ATTACH_TO_JOB, (8) CREATE_NEW_JOB, (9) DELETE_JOB, (10) DELETE_MASTER_TABLE, (11) DETACH_JOB, (12) GET_JOB_INFO, (13) GET_JOB_QUEUES, (14) GET_SOLE_JOBNAME, (15) MASTER_TBL_LOCK, and (16) VALID_HANDLE functions in the SYS.KUPV$FT_INT package.  NOTE: due to the lack of relevant details from the Oracle advisory, a separate CVE is being created since it cannot be conclusively proven that these issues has been addressed by Oracle.  It is unclear which, if any, Oracle Vuln# identifiers apply to these issues.",
