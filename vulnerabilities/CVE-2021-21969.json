	"id": "CVE-2021-21969",
	"description": "An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the HandleSeaCloudMessage functionality of Sealevel Systems, Inc. SeaConnect 370W v1.3.34. The HandleIncomingSeaCloudMessage function uses at [4] the json_object_get_string to populate the p_payload global variable. The p_payload is only 0x100 bytes long, and the total MQTT message could be up to 0x201 bytes. Because the function json_object_get_string will fill str based on the length of the jsonâ€™s value and not the actual str size, this would result in a possible out-of-bounds write.\n\nAffected: n/a Sealevel\" Sealevel Systems, Inc. SeaConnect 370W v1.3.34",
