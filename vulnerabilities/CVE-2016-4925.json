	"description": "Receipt of a specifically malformed IPv6 packet processed by the router may trigger a line card reset: processor exception 0x68616c74 (halt) in task: scheduler. The line card will reboot and recover without user interaction. However, additional specifically malformed packets may cause follow-on line card resets and lead to an extended service outage. This issue only affects E Series routers with IPv6 licensed and enabled. Routers not configured to process IPv6 traffic are unaffected by this vulnerability. Juniper SIRT is not aware of any malicious exploitation of this vulnerability. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue.\n\nAffected: Juniper Networks JunosE 10.3 prior to 10.3.3p0-15, 12.3 prior to 12.3.3p0-6, 13.3 prior to 13.3.3p0-1, 14.3 prior to 14.3.2",
