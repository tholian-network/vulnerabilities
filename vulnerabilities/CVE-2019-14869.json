	"description": "A flaw was found in all versions of ghostscript 9.x before 9.50, where the `.charkeys` procedure, where it did not properly secure its privileged calls, enabling scripts to bypass `-dSAFER` restrictions. An attacker could abuse this flaw by creating a specially crafted PostScript file that could escalate privileges within the Ghostscript and access files outside of restricted areas or execute commands.\n\nA way to escape the -dSAFER sandbox has been found in ghostscript before 9.50. The issue was still present in 9.50 but is mitigated by the recent -dSAFER rework.",
