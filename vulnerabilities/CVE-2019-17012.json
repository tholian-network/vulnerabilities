	"description": "Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 70 and Firefox ESR 68.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.3, Firefox ESR < 68.3, and Firefox < 71.\n\nSeveral memory safety bugs have been found in Firefox before 71.0 and Thunderbird before 68.3. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and Mozilla presumes that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.",
