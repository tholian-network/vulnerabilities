	"id": "CVE-2017-15191",
	"description": "In Wireshark 2.4.0 to 2.4.1, 2.2.0 to 2.2.9, and 2.0.0 to 2.0.15, the DMP dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-dmp.c by validating a string length.\n\nA length check flaw has been discovered in wireshark before 2.4.2 in the BT ATT dissector when 7bit strings were decoded leading to application crash by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.",
