{
	"id": "CVE-2020-15198",
	"description": "In Tensorflow before version 2.3.1, the `SparseCountSparseOutput` implementation does not validate that the input arguments form a valid sparse tensor. In particular, there is no validation that the `indices` tensor has the same shape as the `values` one. The values in these tensors are always accessed in parallel. Thus, a shape mismatch can result in accesses outside the bounds of heap allocated buffers. The issue is patched in commit 3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02 and is released in TensorFlow version 2.3.1.\n\nAffected: tensorflow tensorflow >= 2.3.0, < 2.3.1\n\nAffected: tensorflow tensorflow >= 2.3.0, < 2.3.1",
