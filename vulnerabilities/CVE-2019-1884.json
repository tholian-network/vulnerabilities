The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation mechanisms for certain fields in HTTP/HTTPS requests sent through an affected device. A successful attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious HTTP/HTTPS request through an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to force the device to stop processing traffic, resulting in a DoS condition.\n\nAffected: Cisco Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA)  < 10.5.5-005",
