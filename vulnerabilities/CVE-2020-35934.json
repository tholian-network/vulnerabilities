	"description": "The Advanced Access Manager plugin before 6.6.2 for WordPress displays the unfiltered user object (including all metadata) upon login via the REST API (aam/v1/authenticate or aam/v2/authenticate). This is a security problem if this object stores information that the user is not supposed to have (e.g., custom metadata added by a different plugin).",
