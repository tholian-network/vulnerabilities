	"id": "CVE-2021-21970",
	"description": "An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the HandleSeaCloudMessage functionality of Sealevel Systems, Inc. SeaConnect 370W v1.3.34. The HandleIncomingSeaCloudMessage function uses at [3] the json_object_get_string to populate the p_name global variable. The p_name is only 0x80 bytes long, and the total MQTT message could be up to 0x201 bytes. Because the function json_object_get_string will fill str based on the length of the jsonâ€™s value and not the actual str size, this would result in a possible out-of-bounds write.",
