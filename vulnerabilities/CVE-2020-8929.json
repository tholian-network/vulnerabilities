{
	"id": "CVE-2020-8929",
	"description": "A mis-handling of invalid unicode characters in the Java implementation of Tink versions prior to 1.5 allows an attacker to change the ID part of a ciphertext, which result in the creation of a second ciphertext that can decrypt to the same plaintext. This can be a problem with encrypting deterministic AEAD with a single key, and rely on a unique ciphertext-per-plaintext.\n\nAffected: Google LLC Tink < 1.5\n\nAffected: Google LLC Tink 1.5\n\nAffected: Google LLC Tink 1.5",
