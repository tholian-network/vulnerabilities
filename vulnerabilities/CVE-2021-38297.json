	"id": "CVE-2021-38297",
	"description": "Go before 1.16.9 and 1.17.x before 1.17.2 has a Buffer Overflow via large arguments in a function invocation from a WASM module, when GOARCH=wasm GOOS=js is used.\n\nA security issue has been found in go before version 1.17.2. When invoking functions from WASM modules, built using GOARCH=wasm GOOS=js, passing very large arguments can cause portions of the module to be overwritten with data from the arguments.\r\n\r\nIf using wasm_exec.js to execute WASM modules, users will need to replace their copy (as described in https://golang.org/wiki/WebAssembly#getting-started) after rebuilding any modules.",
