	"description": "A flaw was found in the Ceph RGW configuration with Beast as the front end handling client requests. An unauthenticated attacker could crash the Ceph RGW server by sending valid HTTP headers and terminating the connection, resulting in a remote denial of service for Ceph RGW clients.\n\nAn improper exception condition handling in Ceph allows to any single unauthenticated client to crash RGW component of Ceph by sending a special crafted HTTP request which lead to denial of service. The vulnerability affects the RGW component of Ceph, specifically the ceph-radosgw.",
