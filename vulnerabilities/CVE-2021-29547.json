	"id": "CVE-2021-29547",
	"description": "A security issue has been found in TensorFlow before version 2.4.2. An attacker can cause a segfault and denial of service via accessing data outside of bounds in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedBatchNormWithGlobalNormalization`. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/55a97caa9e99c7f37a0bbbeb414dc55553d3ae7f/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantized_batch_norm_op.cc#L176-L189) assumes the inputs are not empty. If any of these inputs is empty, `.flat<T>()` is an empty buffer, so accessing the element at index 0 is accessing data outside of bounds.",
