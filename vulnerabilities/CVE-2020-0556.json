	"description": "Improper access control in subsystem for BlueZ before version 5.54 may allow an unauthenticated user to potentially enable escalation of privilege and denial of service via adjacent access\n\nIt was discovered that the HID and HOGP profiles implementations in bluez before 5.54 don't specifically require bonding between the device and the host. This creates an opportunity for a malicious device to connect to a target host to either impersonate an existing HID device without security or to cause an SDP or GATT service discovery to take place which would allow HID reports to be injected to the input subsystem from a non-bonded source.\r\nThis potentially enables an unauthenticated attacker with adjacent access to impersonate an existing HID device, cause a denial of service or escalate privileges.",
