	"id": "CVE-2020-16125",
	"description": "gdm3 versions before 3.36.2 or 3.38.2 would start gnome-initial-setup if gdm3 can't contact the accountservice service via dbus in a timely manner; on Ubuntu (and potentially derivatives) this could be be chained with an additional issue that could allow a local user to create a new privileged account.\n\ngdm before 3.38.2 can be tricked into launching gnome-initial-setup, enabling an unprivileged user to create a new user account for themselves. The new account is a member of the sudo group, so this enables the unprivileged user to obtain admin privileges.",
