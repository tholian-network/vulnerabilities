{
	"id": "CVE-2021-32614",
	"description": "A security issue has been found in dmg2img. fill_mishblk() does not check the length of the read buffer, and copies 0xCC bytes from it. The length of the buffer is controlled by an attacker. By providing a length smaller than 0xCC, memcpy reaches out of the malloc'ed bound. This possibly leads to memory layout information leaking in the data. This might be used in a chain of vulnerability in order to reach code execution.",
