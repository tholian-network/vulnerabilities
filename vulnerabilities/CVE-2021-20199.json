	"description": "Rootless containers run with Podman from version 1.8.0 up to 2.2.1 receive all traffic with a source IP address of 127.0.0.1 (including from remote hosts). This impacts containerized applications that trust localhost (127.0.01) connections by default and do not require authentication. The issue is fixed in Podman 3.0.0.",
