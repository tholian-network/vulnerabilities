	"id": "CVE-2019-3856",
	"description": "An integer overflow flaw, which could lead to an out of bounds write, was discovered in libssh2 before 1.8.1 in the way keyboard prompt requests are parsed. A remote attacker who compromises a SSH server may be able to execute code on the client system when a user connects to the server.\n\nAn issue has been found in libssh2 before 1.8.1 where a server could send a value approaching unsigned int max number of keyboard prompt requests which could result in an unchecked integer overflow. The value would then be used to allocate memory causing a possible memory write out of bounds error.",
