	"description": "Rogue Wave JViews before 8.8 patch 21 and 8.9 before patch 1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary Java code that exists in the classpath, such as test code or administration code. The issue exists because the ilog.views.faces.IlvFacesController servlet in jviews-framework-all.jar does not require explicit configuration of servlets that can be called.",
