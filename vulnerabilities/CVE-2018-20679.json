{
	"id": "CVE-2018-20679",
	"description": "An issue was discovered in BusyBox before 1.30.0. An out of bounds read in udhcp components (consumed by the DHCP server, client, and relay) allows a remote attacker to leak sensitive information from the stack by sending a crafted DHCP message. This is related to verification in udhcp_get_option() in networking/udhcp/common.c that 4-byte options are indeed 4 bytes.",
