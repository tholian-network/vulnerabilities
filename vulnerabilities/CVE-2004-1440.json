	"id": "CVE-2004-1440",
	"description": "Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in the modpow function in PuTTY before 0.55 allow (1) remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an SSH2 packet with a base argument that is larger than the mod argument, which causes the modpow function to write memory before the beginning of its buffer, and (2) remote malicious servers to cause a denial of service (client crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a large bignum during authentication.",
