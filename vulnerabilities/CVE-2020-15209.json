	"description": "In tensorflow-lite before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, a crafted TFLite model can force a node to have as input a tensor backed by a `nullptr` buffer. This can be achieved by changing a buffer index in the flatbuffer serialization to convert a read-only tensor to a read-write one. The runtime assumes that these buffers are written to before a possible read, hence they are initialized with `nullptr`. However, by changing the buffer index for a tensor and implicitly converting that tensor to be a read-write one, as there is nothing in the model that writes to it, we get a null pointer dereference. The issue is patched in commit 0b5662bc, and is released in TensorFlow versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.\n\nAffected: tensorflow tensorflow < 1.15.4, >= 2.0.0, < 2.0.3, >= 2.1.0, < 2.1.2, >= 2.2.0, < 2.2.1, >= 2.3.0, < 2.3.1\n\nAffected: tensorflow tensorflow < 1.15.4, >= 2.0.0, < 2.0.3, >= 2.1.0, < 2.1.2, >= 2.2.0, < 2.2.1, >= 2.3.0, < 2.3.1",
