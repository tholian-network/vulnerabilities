	"id": "CVE-2021-4008",
	"description": "A flaw was found in xorg-x11-server in versions before 21.1.2 and before 1.20.14. An out-of-bounds access can occur in the SProcRenderCompositeGlyphs function. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\nA security issue has been found in X.Org before version 21.1.2 and Xwayland before version 21.1.4. The handler for the CompositeGlyphs request of the Render extension does not properly validate the request length leading to out of bounds memory write. This can lead to local privileges elevation on systems where the X server is running privileged and remote code execution for SSH X forwarding sessions.",
