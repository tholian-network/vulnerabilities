	"id": "CVE-2006-6289",
	"description": "Woltlab Burning Board (wBB) Lite 1.0.2 does not properly unset variables when the input data includes a numeric parameter with a value matching an alphanumeric parameter's hash value, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the wbb_userid parameter to the top-level URI.  NOTE: it could be argued that this vulnerability is due to a bug in the unset PHP command (CVE-2006-3017) and the proper fix should be in PHP; if so, then this should not be treated as a vulnerability in wBB Lite.",
