	"description": "A flaw was found in libtpms in versions before 0.8.2. The commonly used integration of libtpms with OpenSSL contained a vulnerability related to the returned IV (initialization vector) when certain symmetric ciphers were used. Instead of returning the last IV it returned the initial IV to the caller, thus weakening the subsequent encryption and decryption steps. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.\n\nAffected: n/a libtpms libtpms 0.8.2\n\nThe commonly used integration of libtpms before version 0.8.2 with OpenSSL contained a vulnerability related to the returned IV (initialization vector) when certain symmetric ciphers were used. Instead of returning the last IV it returned the initial IV to the caller. The fix for this required the copying of the last-used IV from OpenSSL so it can be return back to the caller and used in subsequent encryption and decryption steps. The side-effect of the fix is that previously chain-encrypted data will not be decryptable anymore with the TPM 2.",
