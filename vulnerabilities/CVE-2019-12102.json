	"id": "CVE-2019-12102",
	"description": "Kentico 11 through 12 lets attackers upload and explore files without authentication via the cmsmodules/medialibrary/formcontrols/liveselectors/insertimageormedia/tabs_media.aspx URI. NOTE: The vendor disputes the report because the researcher did not configure the media library permissions correctly. The vendor states that by default all users can read/modify/upload files, and itâ€™s up to the administrator to decide who should have access to the media library and set the permissions accordingly. See the vendor documentation in the references for more information",
