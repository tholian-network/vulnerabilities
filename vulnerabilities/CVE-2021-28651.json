	"id": "CVE-2021-28651",
	"description": "An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.15 and 5.x before 5.0.6. Due to a buffer-management bug, it allows a denial of service. When resolving a request with the urn: scheme, the parser leaks a small amount of memory. However, there is an unspecified attack methodology that can easily trigger a large amount of memory consumption.\n\nDue to a buffer management bug Squid before version 4.15 is vulnerable to a denial of service attack against the server it is operating on. This attack is limited to proxies which attempt to resolve a \"urn:\" resource identifier. Support for this resolving is enabled by default in all Squid.",
