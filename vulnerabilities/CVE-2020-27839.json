	"id": "CVE-2020-27839",
	"description": "A flaw was found in ceph-dashboard. The JSON Web Token (JWT) used for user authentication is stored by the frontend application in the browserâ€™s localStorage which is potentially vulnerable to attackers via XSS attacks. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.\n\nAffected: n/a ceph-dashboard ceph-dashboard 14.2.17, ceph-dashboard 15.2.9\n\nA security issue was found in ceph in versions prior to 15.2.9. The JWT token used by the ceph dashboard for authorising against the API was stored inside the local storage of the browser, making it vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks. Ceph version 15.2.9 mitigates this issue by using secure cookies for storage instead.",
