	"description": "In Wireshark 2.6.0 to 2.6.4 and 2.4.0 to 2.4.10, the IxVeriWave file parser could crash. This was addressed in wiretap/vwr.c by adjusting a buffer boundary.\n\nAn out-of-bounds read has been found in the IxVeriWave file parser of Wireshark versions prior to 2.6.5, which could be triggered by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file",
