	"description": "An out-of-bounds access flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s implementation of the eBPF code verifier, where an incorrect register bounds calculation while checking 32-bit instructions in an eBPF program occurs. This flaw allows an unprivileged user or process to execute eBPF programs to crash the kernel, resulting in a denial of service or potentially gaining root privileges on the system.",
