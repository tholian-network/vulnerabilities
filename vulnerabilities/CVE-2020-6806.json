	"description": "By carefully crafting promise resolutions, it was possible to cause an out-of-bounds read off the end of an array resized during script execution. This could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.6, Firefox < 74, Firefox < ESR68.6, and Firefox ESR < 68.6.\n\nA state confusion issue has been found in Firefox before 74 and Thunderbird before 68.6, in BodyStream::OnInputStreamReady.
