	"id": "CVE-2021-25289",
	"description": "An issue was discovered in Pillow before 8.1.1. TiffDecode has a heap-based buffer overflow when decoding crafted YCbCr files because of certain interpretation conflicts with LibTIFF in RGBA mode. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-35654.\n\nA security issue was found in python-pillow before version 8.1.1. The previous fix for CVE-2020-35654 was insufficent due to incorrect error checking in TiffDecode.c, so the potentially exploitable heap-based buffer overflow when decoding crafted YCbCr files is still possible.",
