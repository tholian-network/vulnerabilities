	"id": "CVE-2017-15276",
	"description": "OpenText Documentum Content Server (formerly EMC Documentum Content Server) through 7.3 contains the following design gap, which allows an authenticated user to gain superuser privileges: Content Server allows uploading content using batches (TAR archives). When unpacking TAR archives, Content Server fails to verify the contents of an archive, which causes a path traversal vulnerability via symlinks. Because some files on the Content Server filesystem are security-sensitive, this leads to privilege escalation.",
