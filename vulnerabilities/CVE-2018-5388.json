	"description": "In stroke_socket.c in strongSwan before 5.6.3, a missing packet length check could allow a buffer underflow, which may lead to resource exhaustion and denial of service while reading from the socket.\n\nstrongSwan VPN's charon server prior to version 5.6.3 is missing a packet length check in stroke_socket.c, allowing a buffer overflow which may lead to resource exhaustion and denial of service while reading from the socket.\r\nAccording to the vendor, an attacker must typically have local root permissions to access the socket. However, other accounts and groups such as the vpn group (if capability dropping in enabled, for example) may also have sufficient permissions, but this configuration does not appear to be the default behavior.",
