	"id": "CVE-2020-15479",
	"description": "An issue was discovered in PassMark BurnInTest through 9.1, OSForensics through 7.1, and PerformanceTest through 10. The driver's IOCTL request handler attempts to copy the input buffer onto the stack without checking its size and can cause a buffer overflow. This could lead to arbitrary Ring-0 code execution and escalation of privileges. This affects DirectIo32.sys and DirectIo64.sys.",
