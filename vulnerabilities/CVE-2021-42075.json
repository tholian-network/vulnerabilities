	"description": "An issue was discovered in Barrier before 2.3.4. The barriers component (aka the server-side implementation of Barrier) does not correctly close file descriptors for established TCP connections. An unauthenticated remote attacker can thus cause file descriptor exhaustion in the server process, leading to denial of service.\n\nA security issue has been found in Barrier before version 2.3.4. The daemon does not correctly close client sockets causing permanent file descriptor exhaustion and thus remote denial of service within a couple of seconds by just opening and closing connections.\r\n\r\nAfter 1023 file descriptors are open the server will still react to connection requests, but will fail to open its own local certificate and thus close the connection prematurely. This issue could be used as an additional attack vector during other stages of the protocol to trigger file/socket open failures with potentially security related effects.",
