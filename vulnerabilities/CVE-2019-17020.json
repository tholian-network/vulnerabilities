	"description": "If an XML file is served with a Content Security Policy and the XML file includes an XSL stylesheet, the Content Security Policy will not be applied to the contents of the XSL stylesheet. If the XSL sheet e.g. includes JavaScript, it would bypass any of the restrictions of the Content Security Policy applied to the XML document. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 72.\n\nA Content Security Policy bypass has been found in Firefox before 72.0, where the CSP is not applied to XSL stylesheets applied to XML documents. If the XSL sheet e.g. includes JavaScript, it would bypass any of the restrictions of the Content Security Policy applied to the XML document.",
