	"id": "CVE-2020-10143",
	"description": "Macrium Reflect includes an OpenSSL component that specifies an OPENSSLDIR variable as C:\\openssl\\. Macrium Reflect contains a privileged service that uses this OpenSSL component. Because unprivileged Windows users can create subdirectories off of the system root, a user can create the appropriate path to a specially-crafted openssl.cnf file to achieve arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges.\n\nAffected: Macrium Reflect < 7.2*, < 7.3.5281",
