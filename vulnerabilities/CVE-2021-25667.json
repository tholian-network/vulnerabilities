	"description": "A vulnerability has been identified in RUGGEDCOM RM1224 (All versions >= V4.3 and < V6.4), SCALANCE M-800 (All versions >= V4.3 and < V6.4), SCALANCE S615 (All versions >= V4.3 and < V6.4), SCALANCE SC-600 Family (All versions >= V2.0 and < V2.1.3), SCALANCE XB-200 (All versions < V4.1), SCALANCE XC-200 (All versions < V4.1), SCALANCE XF-200BA (All versions < V4.1), SCALANCE XM400 (All versions < V6.2), SCALANCE XP-200 (All versions < V4.1), SCALANCE XR-300WG (All versions < V4.1), SCALANCE XR500 (All versions < V6.2). Affected devices contain a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the handling of STP BPDU frames that could allow a remote attacker to trigger a denial-of-service condition or potentially remote code execution. Successful exploitation requires the passive listening feature of the device to be active.\n\nAffected: Siemens RUGGEDCOM RM1224 All versions >= V4.3 and < V6.4\nAffected: Siemens SCALANCE M-800 All versions >= V4.3 and < V6.4\nAffected: Siemens SCALANCE S615 All versions >= V4.3 and < V6.4\nAffected: Siemens SCALANCE SC-600 Family All versions >= V2.0 and < V2.1.3\nAffected: Siemens SCALANCE XB-200 All versions < V4.1\nAffected: Siemens SCALANCE XC-200 All versions < V4.1\nAffected: Siemens SCALANCE XF-200BA All versions < V4.1\nAffected: Siemens SCALANCE XM400 All versions < V6.2\nAffected: Siemens SCALANCE XP-200 All versions < V4.1\nAffected: Siemens SCALANCE XR-300WG All versions < V4.1\nAffected: Siemens SCALANCE XR500 All versions < V6.2",
