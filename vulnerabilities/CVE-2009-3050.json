	"description": "Buffer overflow in the set_page_size function in util.cxx in HTMLDOC 1.8.27 and earlier allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long MEDIA SIZE comment.  NOTE: it was later reported that there were additional vectors in htmllib.cxx and ps-pdf.cxx using an AFM font file with a long glyph name, but these vectors do not cross privilege boundaries.",
