	"id": "CVE-2017-1000369",
	"description": "Exim supports the use of multiple \"-p\" command line arguments which are malloc()'ed and never free()'ed, used in conjunction with other issues allows attackers to cause arbitrary code execution. This affects exim version 4.89 and earlier. Please note that at this time upstream has released a patch (commit 65e061b76867a9ea7aeeb535341b790b90ae6c21), but it is not known if a new point release is available that addresses this issue at this time.\n\nAn uncontrolled resource consumption flaw has been discovered in Exim before 4.89.1. The use of multiple \"-p\" command line arguments which are malloc()'ed and never free()'ed results in leaking memory. While Exim itself is not vulnerable to privilege escalation, this particular flaw can be used by the stackguard vulnerability to achieve privilege escalation.",
