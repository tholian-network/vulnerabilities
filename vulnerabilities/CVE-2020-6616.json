{
	"id": "CVE-2020-6616",
	"description": "Some Broadcom chips mishandle Bluetooth random-number generation because a low-entropy Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG) is used in situations where a Hardware Random Number Generator (HRNG) should have been used to prevent spoofing. This affects, for example, Samsung Galaxy S8, S8+, and Note8 devices with the BCM4361 chipset. The Samsung ID is SVE-2020-16882 (May 2020).",
