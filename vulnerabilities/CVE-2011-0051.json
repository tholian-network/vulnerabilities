	"description": "Mozilla Firefox before 3.5.17 and 3.6.x before 3.6.14, and SeaMonkey before 2.0.12, does not properly handle certain recursive eval calls, which makes it easier for remote attackers to force a user to respond positively to a dialog question, as demonstrated by a question about granting privileges.",
