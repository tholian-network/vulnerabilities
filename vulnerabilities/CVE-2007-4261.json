{
	"id": "CVE-2007-4261",
	"description": "EZPhotoSales 1.9.3 and earlier stores sensitive information under the web root with insufficient access control, which allows remote attackers to download (1) a file containing cleartext passwords via a direct request for OnlineViewing/data/galleries.txt, or (2) a file containing username hashes and password hashes via a direct request for OnlineViewing/configuration/config.dat/.  NOTE: vector 2 can be leveraged for administrative access because authentication does not require knowledge of cleartext values, but instead uses the username hash in the ConfigLogin parameter and the password hash in the ConfigPassword parameter.",
