	"description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in the MegaRAID emulator of QEMU. This issue occurs while processing SCSI I/O requests in the case of an error mptsas_free_request() that does not dequeue the request object 'req' from a pending requests queue. This flaw allows a privileged guest user to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service. Versions between 2.10.0 and 5.2.0 are potentially affected.\n\nA use-after-free issue was found in the Megaraid emulator of the QEMU. It occurs while processing SCSI I/O requests because in case of an error mptsas_free_request() does not dequeue request object 'req' from a pending requests' queue. Which later gets processed resulting in the said use-after-free issue. A privileged guest user may use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host resulting in a denial of service scenario.",
