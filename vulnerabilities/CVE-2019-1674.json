	"description": "A vulnerability in the update service of Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App and Cisco Webex Productivity Tools for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands as a privileged user. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by invoking the update service command with a crafted argument. An exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands with SYSTEM user privileges. While the CVSS Attack Vector metric denotes the requirement for an attacker to have local access, administrators should be aware that in Active Directory deployments, the vulnerability could be exploited remotely by leveraging the operating system remote management tools. This vulnerability is fixed in Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App Release 33.6.6 and 33.9.1 releases. This vulnerability is fixed in Cisco Webex Productivity Tools Release 33.0.7.\n\nAffected: Cisco Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App  < 33.6.6, < 33.9.1\nAffected: Cisco Cisco Webex Productivity Tools < 33.0.7\n\nAffected: Cisco Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App 33.6.6, 33.9.1\nAffected: Cisco Cisco Webex Productivity Tools 33.0.7\n\nAffected: Cisco Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App 33.6.6, 33.9.1\nAffected: Cisco Cisco Webex Productivity Tools 33.0.7",
