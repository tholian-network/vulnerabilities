The vulnerability is limited to the DUP framework during the time window when a DUP is being executed by an administrator. During this time window, a locally authenticated low privilege malicious user potentially could exploit this vulnerability by tricking an administrator into running a trusted binary, causing it to load a malicious DLL and allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim system. The vulnerability does not affect the actual binary payload that the DUP delivers.",
