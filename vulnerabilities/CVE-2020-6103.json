	"description": "An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the Shader functionality of AMD Radeon DirectX 11 Driver atidxx64.dll 26.20.15019.19000. An attacker can provide a a specially crafted shader file to trigger this vulnerability, resulting in code execution. This vulnerability can be triggered from a HYPER-V guest using the RemoteFX feature, leading to executing the vulnerable code on the HYPER-V host (inside of the rdvgm.exe process). Theoretically this vulnerability could be also triggered from web browser (using webGL and webassembly).\n\nAffected: n/a AMD AMD Radeon DirectX 11 Driver atidxx64.dll 26.20.15019.19000",
