	"id": "CVE-2020-7469",
	"description": "In FreeBSD 12.2-STABLE before r367402, 11.4-STABLE before r368202, 12.2-RELEASE before p1, 12.1-RELEASE before p11 and 11.4-RELEASE before p5 the handler for a routing option caches a pointer into the packet buffer holding the ICMPv6 message. However, when processing subsequent options the packet buffer may be freed, rendering the cached pointer invalid. The network stack may later dereference the pointer, potentially triggering a use-after-free.\n\nAffected: n/a FreeBSD FreeBSD 12.2-RELEASE before p1, 12.1-RELEASE before p11, 11.4-RELEASE before p5",
