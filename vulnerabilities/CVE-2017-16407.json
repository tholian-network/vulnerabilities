The vulnerability is caused by a computation that writes data past the end of the intended buffer; the computation is part of handling an EMF EMR_BITBLT record. The vulnerability is a result of an out of range pointer offset that is used to access sub-elements of an internal data structure. An attacker can potentially leverage the vulnerability to corrupt sensitive data or execute arbitrary code.\n\nAffected: n/a Adobe Acrobat Reader 2017.012.20098 and earlier versions, 2017.011.30066 and earlier versions, 2015.006.30355 and earlier versions, 11.0.22 and earlier versions Adobe Acrobat Reader 2017.012.20098 and earlier versions, 2017.011.30066 and earlier versions, 2015.006.30355 and earlier versions, 11.0.22 and earlier versions",
