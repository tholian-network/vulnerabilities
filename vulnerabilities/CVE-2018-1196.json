	"id": "CVE-2018-1196",
	"description": "Spring Boot supports an embedded launch script that can be used to easily run the application as a systemd or init.d linux service. The script included with Spring Boot 1.5.9 and earlier and 2.0.0.M1 through 2.0.0.M7 is susceptible to a symlink attack which allows the \"run_user\" to overwrite and take ownership of any file on the same system. In order to instigate the attack, the application must be installed as a service and the \"run_user\" requires shell access to the server. Spring Boot application that are not installed as a service, or are not using the embedded launch script are not susceptible.\n\nAffected: Dell EMC Spring Boot 1.5.0 - 1.5.9, 2.0.0.M1 - 2.0.0.M7\n\nAffected: Dell EMC Spring Boot <= 1.5.9, 2.0.0.M1 - 2.0.0.M7\n\nAffected: Dell EMC Spring Boot <= 1.5.9, 2.0.0.M1 - 2.0.0.M7",
