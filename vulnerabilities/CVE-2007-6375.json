	"description": "Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Bitweaver 2.0.0 and earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) sort_mode parameter to wiki/list_pages.php and the (2) highlight parameter to search/index.php.  NOTE: the researcher also reported injection via JavaScript code in the Search box, but this is probably a forced SQL error or other separate primary issue.",
