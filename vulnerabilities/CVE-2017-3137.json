	"id": "CVE-2017-3137",
	"description": "Mistaken assumptions about the ordering of records in the answer section of a response containing CNAME or DNAME resource records could lead to a situation in which named would exit with an assertion failure when processing a response in which records occurred in an unusual order. Affects BIND 9.9.9-P6, 9.9.10b1->9.9.10rc1, 9.10.4-P6, 9.10.5b1->9.10.5rc1, 9.11.0-P3, 9.11.1b1->9.11.1rc1, and 9.9.9-S8.\n\nA security issue has been found in bind, where a server which is performing recursion can be forced to exit with an assertion failure if it can be caused to receive a response containing CNAME or DNAME resource records with certain ordering.",
