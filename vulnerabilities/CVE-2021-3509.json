	"description": "A flaw was found in Red Hat Ceph Storage 4, in the Dashboard component. In response to CVE-2020-27839, the JWT token was moved from localStorage to an httpOnly cookie. However, token cookies are used in the body of the HTTP response for the documentation, which again makes it available to XSS.The greatest threat to the system is for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\nA security issue was found in ceph before version 15.2.12. In order to make the JWT token inaccessible through cross-site scripting (XSS), it was moved from localStorage to httpOnly Cookie (CVE-2020-27839). But token cookies are used in the body of the HTTP response for the documentation, which again makes it available to XSS.",
