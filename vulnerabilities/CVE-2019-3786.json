	"id": "CVE-2019-3786",
	"description": "Cloud Foundry BOSH Backup and Restore CLI, all versions prior to 1.5.0, does not check the authenticity of backup scripts in BOSH. A remote authenticated malicious user can modify the metadata file of a Bosh Backup and Restore job to request extra backup files from different jobs upon restore. The exploited hooks in this metadata script were only maintained in the cfcr-etcd-release, so clusters deployed with the BBR job for etcd in this release are vulnerable.\n\nAffected: Cloud Foundry BOSH Backup and Restore < v1.5.0\n\nAffected: Cloud Foundry BOSH Backup and Restore v1.5.0\n\nAffected: Cloud Foundry BOSH Backup and Restore v1.5.0",
