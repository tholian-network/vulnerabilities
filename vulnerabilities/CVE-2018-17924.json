	"description": "Rockwell Automation MicroLogix 1400 Controllers and 1756 ControlLogix Communications Modules An unauthenticated, remote threat actor could send a CIP connection request to an affected device, and upon successful connection, send a new IP configuration to the affected device even if the controller in the system is set to Hard RUN mode. When the affected device accepts this new IP configuration, a loss of communication occurs between the device and the rest of the system as the system traffic is still attempting to communicate with the device via the overwritten IP address.\n\nAffected: n/a Rockwell Automation MicroLogix 1400 Controllers Series A, all versions, Series B, v21.003 and earlier,Series C, v21.003 and earlier, 1756 ControlLogix EtherNet/IP Communications Modules 1756-ENBT, all versions, 1756-EWEB Series A, all versions Series B, all versions, 1756-EN2F Series A, all versions, Series B, all versions, Series C, v10.10 and earlier, 1756-EN2T, Series A, all versions, Series B, all versions, Series C, all versions, Series D, v10.10 and earlier, 1756-EN2TR, Series A, all versions, Series B, all versions, Series C, v10.10 and earlier, 1756-EN3TR, Series A, all versions, Series B, v10.10 and earlier.",
