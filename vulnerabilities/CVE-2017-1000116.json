	"description": "Mercurial prior to 4.3 did not adequately sanitize hostnames passed to ssh, leading to possible shell-injection attacks.\n\nMercurial < 4.3 was not sanitizing hostnames passed to ssh, allowing shell injection attacks on clients by specifying a hostname starting with -oProxyCommand. This is also present in Git (CVE-2017-1000117) and Subversion (CVE-2017-9800), so please patch those tools as well if you have them installed.",
