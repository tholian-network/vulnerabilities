	"description": "The default cloud-init configuration, in cloud-init 0.6.2 and newer, included \"ssh_deletekeys: 0\", disabling cloud-init's deletion of ssh host keys. In some environments, this could lead to instances created by cloning a golden master or template system, sharing ssh host keys, and being able to impersonate one another or conduct man-in-the-middle attacks.",
