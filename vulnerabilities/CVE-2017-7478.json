	"description": "OpenVPN version 2.3.12 and newer is vulnerable to unauthenticated Denial of Service of server via received large control packet. Note that this issue is fixed in 2.3.15 and 2.4.2.\n\nA security issue has been found in OpenVPN <= 2.4.1 where an unauthenticated attacker can send a packet with an unexpected payload size during SSL handshake, causing a server shutdown. Servers using tls-auth are protected against this attack as packets with an invalid HMAC are discarded before being processed by the vulnerable code.",
