	"description": "Cisco Catalyst 4000 series switches running CatOS 5.5.5, 6.3.5, and 7.1.2 do not always learn MAC addresses from a single initial packet, which causes unicast traffic to be broadcast across the switch and allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive network information by sniffing.",
