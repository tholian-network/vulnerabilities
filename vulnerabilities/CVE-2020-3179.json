	"description": "A vulnerability in the generic routing encapsulation (GRE) tunnel decapsulation feature of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a memory handling error when GRE over IPv6 traffic is processed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted GRE over IPv6 packets with either IPv4 or IPv6 payload through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to crash, resulting in a DoS condition.",
