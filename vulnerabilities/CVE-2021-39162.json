	"id": "CVE-2021-39162",
	"description": "Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. Envoy, which Pomerium is based on, can abnormally terminate if an H/2 GOAWAY and SETTINGS frame are received in the same IO event. This can lead to a DoS in the presence of untrusted *upstream* servers. 0.15.1 contains an upgraded envoy binary with this vulnerability patched. If only trusted upstreams are configured, there is not substantial risk of this condition being triggered.\n\nAffected: pomerium pomerium >= 0.15.0, < 0.15.1\n\nAffected: pomerium pomerium >= 0.15.0, < 0.15.1",
