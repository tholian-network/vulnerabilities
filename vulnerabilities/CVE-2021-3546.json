	"description": "An out-of-bounds write vulnerability was found in the virtio vhost-user GPU device (vhost-user-gpu) of QEMU in versions up to and including 6.0. The flaw occurs while processing the 'VIRTIO_GPU_CMD_GET_CAPSET' command from the guest. It could allow a privileged guest user to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition, or potential code execution with the privileges of the QEMU process.\n\nAn out-of-bounds write vulnerability was found in the virtio vhost-user GPU device (vhost-user-gpu) of QEMU. The flaw exists in virgl_cmd_get_capset() in contrib/vhost-user-gpu/virgl.c and could occur while processing the 'VIRTIO_GPU_CMD_GET_CAPSET' command. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service, or potentially execute arbitrary code on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.",
