	"description": "There's a flaw in the BFD library of binutils in versions before 2.36. An attacker who supplies a crafted file to an application linked with BFD, and using the DWARF functionality, could cause an impact to system availability by way of excessive memory consumption.\n\nA security issue was found in  the BFD library of binutils before version 2.36. read_section() in dwarf2.c of BFD could cause excessive memory consumption when handling corrupt DWARF debug sections. This could lead to an impact to system availability, denial of service, and/or a crash in applications linked with the BFD library's DWARF functionality if they parse files from untrusted sources.",
