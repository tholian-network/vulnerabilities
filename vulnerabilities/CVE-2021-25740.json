	"description": "A security issue was discovered with Kubernetes that could enable users to send network traffic to locations they would otherwise not have access to via a confused deputy attack.\n\nA security issue was discovered with Kubernetes that could enable users to send network traffic to locations they would otherwise not have access to via a confused deputy attack. If a potential attacker can create or edit Endpoints or EndpointSlices in the Kubernetes API, they can potentially direct a LoadBalancer or Ingress implementation to expose backend IPs the attacker should not have access to. Importantly, if the targetâ€™s NetworkPolicy already trusts the Load Balancer or Ingress implementation, NetworkPolicy can not be used to prevent exposure from other namespaces, potentially bypassing any security controls such as LoadBalancerSourceRanges.",
