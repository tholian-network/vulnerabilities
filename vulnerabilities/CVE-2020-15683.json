	"description": "Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 81 and Firefox ESR 78.3. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.4, Firefox < 82, and Thunderbird < 78.4.\n\nSeveral memory safety bugs have been found in Firefox before 82.0 and Firefox ESR before 78.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and Mozilla presumes that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.",
