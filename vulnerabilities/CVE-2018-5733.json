	"id": "CVE-2018-5733",
	"description": "A malicious client which is allowed to send very large amounts of traffic (billions of packets) to a DHCP server can eventually overflow a 32-bit reference counter, potentially causing dhcpd to crash. Affects ISC DHCP 4.1.0 -> 4.1-ESV-R15, 4.2.0 -> 4.2.8, 4.3.0 -> 4.3.6, 4.4.0.\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way dhcpd handled reference counting when processing client requests. A malicious DHCP client could use this flaw to trigger a reference count overflow on the server side, potentially causing dhcpd to crash, by sending large amounts of traffic.",
