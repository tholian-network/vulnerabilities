	"description": "Keystone only verifies part of the secret - the first 72 characters. Additional complexity is ignored, giving users an inflated sense of security. Default length of a secret seems to be 86 characters. While brute forcing at this scale is out of reach for many attackers, the state of the art is constantly evolving.",
