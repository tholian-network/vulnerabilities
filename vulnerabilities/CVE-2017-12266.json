	"description": "A vulnerability in the routine that loads DLL files in Cisco Meeting App for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to run an executable file with privileges equivalent to those of Cisco Meeting App. The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of the path name for DLL files before they are loaded. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by installing a crafted DLL file in a specific system directory. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands on the underlying Microsoft Windows host with privileges equivalent to those of Cisco Meeting App. The attacker would need valid user credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
