In systeminformation before version 5.3.1 there is a command injection vulnerability. Problem was fixed in version 5.3.1. As a workaround instead of upgrading, be sure to check or sanitize service parameters that are passed to si.inetLatency(), si.inetChecksite(), si.services(), si.processLoad() ... do only allow strings, reject any arrays. String sanitation works as expected.\n\nAffected: sebhildebrandt systeminformation < 5.3.1\n\nIn this vulnerability, an attacker can send a malicious payload that will exploit the name parameter. After successful exploitation, attackers can execute remote.",
