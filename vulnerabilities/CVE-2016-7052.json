	"id": "CVE-2016-7052",
	"description": "crypto/x509/x509_vfy.c in OpenSSL 1.0.2i allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) by triggering a CRL operation.\n\nA bug fix which included a CRL sanity check was added to OpenSSL 1.1.0 but was omitted from OpenSSL 1.0.2i. As a result any attempt to use CRLs in OpenSSL 1.0.2i will crash with a null pointer exception.\nThe issue was reported to OpenSSL on 22nd September 2016 by Bruce Stephens and Thomas Jakobi.",
