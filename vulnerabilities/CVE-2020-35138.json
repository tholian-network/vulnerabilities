	"description": "The MobileIron agents through 2021-03-22 for Android and iOS contain a hardcoded encryption key, used to encrypt the submission of username/password details during the authentication process, as demonstrated by Mobile@Work (aka com.mobileiron). The key is in the com/mobileiron/common/utils/C4928m.java file. NOTE: It has been asserted that there is no causality or connection between credential encryption and the MiTM attack",
