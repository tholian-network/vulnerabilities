	"description": "A vulnerability was found in Moodle where javaScript injection was possible in some Mustache templates via recursive rendering from contexts.

This affects versions 3.7 to 3.7.1, 3.6 to 3.6.5, 3.5 to 3.5.7 and earlier unsupported versions.\n\nAffected: n/a Moodle 3.7 to 3.7.1, 3.6 to 3.6.5, 3.5 to 3.5.7 and earlier unsupported versions",
