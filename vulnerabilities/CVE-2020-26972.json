	"id": "CVE-2020-26972",
	"description": "A security issue was found in Firefox before 84.0. The lifecycle of IPC Actors allows managed actors to outlive their manager actors; and the former must ensure that they are not attempting to use a dead actor they have a reference to. Such a check was omitted in WebGL, resulting in a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash.",
