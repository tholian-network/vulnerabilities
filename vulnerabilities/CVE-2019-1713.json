	"id": "CVE-2019-1713",
	"description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could alter the configuration of, extract information from, or reload an affected device.\n\nAffected: Cisco Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software  < 9.4.4.34, < 9.6.4.25, < 9.8.4, < 9.9.2.50, < 9.10.1.17",
