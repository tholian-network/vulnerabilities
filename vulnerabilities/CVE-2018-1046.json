	"description": "An issue has been found in the dnsreplay tool provided with PowerDNS Authoritative, where replaying a specially crafted PCAP file can trigger a stack based buffer overflow, leading to a crash and potentially arbitrary code execution. This buffer overflow only occurs when the --ecs-stamp option of dnsreplay is used. Regardless of this issue, the use of dnsreplay with untrusted PCAP files is not advised.",
