	"id": "CVE-2018-16984",
	"description": "An issue was discovered in Django 2.1 before 2.1.2, in which unprivileged users can read the password hashes of arbitrary accounts. The read-only password widget used by the Django Admin to display an obfuscated password hash was bypassed if a user has only the \"view\" permission (new in Django 2.1), resulting in display of the entire password hash to those users. This may result in a vulnerability for sites with legacy user accounts using insecure hashes.\n\nIf an admin user has the change permission to the user model, only part of the password hash is displayed in the change form. Admin users with the view (but not change) permission to the user model were displayed the entire hash. While it's typically infeasible to reverse a strong password hash, if your site uses weaker password hashing algorithms such as MD5 or SHA1, it could be a problem.",
