	"description": "PostgreSQL versions before 9.2.22, 9.3.18, 9.4.13, 9.5.8 and 9.6.4 are vulnerable to authorization flaw allowing remote authenticated attackers to retrieve passwords from the user mappings defined by the foreign server owners without actually having the privileges to do so.\n\nAn authorization flaw was found in the way PostgreSQL handled access to the pg_user_mappings view on foreign servers. A remote authenticated attacker could potentially use this flaw to retrieve passwords from the user mappings defined by the foreign server owners without actually having the privileges to do so.",
