	"id": "CVE-2017-9445",
	"description": "In systemd through 233, certain sizes passed to dns_packet_new in systemd-resolved can cause it to allocate a buffer that's too small. A malicious DNS server can exploit this via a response with a specially crafted TCP payload to trick systemd-resolved into allocating a buffer that's too small, and subsequently write arbitrary data beyond the end of it.\n\nAn out-of-bounds write was discovered in systemd-resolved when handling specially crafted DNS responses. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) or execute arbitrary code.",
