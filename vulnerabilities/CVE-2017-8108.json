	"description": "Unspecified tests in Lynis before 2.5.0 allow local users to write to arbitrary files or possibly gain privileges via a symlink attack on a temporary file.\n\nMichael Scherer discovered that some Lynis tests reuse the same temporary file. As some tests remove the temporary file, this might give an attacker the possibility to perform a link following attack. While timing must be perfect, there is a very small time window in which the attack can recreate the temporary file and symlink it to another resource, like a file. In this case data may be overwritten, or possibly executed.",
