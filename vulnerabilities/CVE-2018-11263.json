	"description": "In all Android releases (Android for MSM, Firefox OS for MSM, QRD Android) from CAF using the Linux kernel, radio_id is received from the FW and is used to access the buffer to copy the radio stats received for each radio from FW.

On supported Google Pixel and Nexus devices, this has been addressed in security patch level 2018-08-05.\n\nAffected: Qualcomm, Inc.
