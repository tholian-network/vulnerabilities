	"id": "CVE-2022-1183",
	"description": "An assertion failure can be triggered if a TLS connection to a configured http TLS listener with a defined endpoint is destroyed too early.\r\n\r\nOn vulnerable configurations, the named daemon may, in some circumstances, terminate with an assertion failure. Vulnerable configurations are those that include a reference to http within the listen-on statements in their named.conf. TLS is used by both DNS over TLS (DoT) and DNS over HTTPS (DoH), but configurations using DoT alone are unaffected.",
