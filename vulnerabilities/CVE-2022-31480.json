	"id": "CVE-2022-31480",
	"description": "An unauthenticated attacker could arbitrarily upload firmware files to the target device, ultimately causing a Denial-of-Service (DoS). This vulnerability impacts products based on HID Mercury Intelligent Controllers LP1501, LP1502, LP2500, LP4502, and EP4502 which contain firmware versions prior to 1.302 for the LP series and 1.296 for the EP series. The attacker needs to have a properly signed and encrypted binary, loading the firmware to the device ultimately triggers a reboot.\n\nAffected: LenelS2 LNL-X2210 < 1.302\nAffected: LenelS2 LNL-X2220 < 1.302\nAffected: LenelS2 LNL-X3300 < 1.302\nAffected: LenelS2 LNL-X4420 < 1.302\nAffected: LenelS2 LNL-4420 < 1.296\nAffected: LenelS2 S2-LP-1501 < 1.302\nAffected: LenelS2 S2-LP-1502 < 1.302\nAffected: LenelS2 S2-LP-2500 < 1.302\nAffected: LenelS2 S2-LP-4502 < 1.302\nAffected: HID Mercury LP1501 < 1.302\nAffected: HID Mercury LP1502 < 1.302\nAffected: HID Mercury LP2500 < 1.302\nAffected: HID Mercury LP4502 < 1.302\nAffected: HID Mercury EP4502 < 1.296",
