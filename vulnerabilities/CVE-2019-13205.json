	"description": "All configuration parameters of certain Kyocera printers (such as the ECOSYS M5526cdw 2R7_2000.001.701) were accessible by unauthenticated users. This information was only presented in the menus when authenticated, and the pages that loaded this information were also protected. However, all files that contained the configuration parameters were accessible. These files contained sensitive information, such as users, community strings, and other passwords configured in the printer.",
