	"description": "Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. In affected versions maliciously crafted requests could lead to remote code execution. This resulted from a lack of validation in subscribe_url values. This issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse. To workaround the issue without updating, requests with a path starting /webhooks/aws path could be blocked at an upstream proxy.\n\nAffected: discourse discourse tests-passed < 2.8.0.beta7, beta < 2.8.0.beta7, stable < 2.7.9\n\nAffected: discourse discourse tests-passed < 2.8.0.beta7, beta < 2.8.0.beta7, stable < 2.7.9",
