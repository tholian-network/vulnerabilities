	"id": "CVE-2019-16201",
	"description": "WEBrick::HTTPAuth::DigestAuth in Ruby through 2.4.7, 2.5.x through 2.5.6, and 2.6.x through 2.6.4 has a regular expression Denial of Service cause by looping/backtracking. A victim must expose a WEBrick server that uses DigestAuth to the Internet or a untrusted network.\n\nIt has been discovered that Ruby before 2.4.8, 2.5.7 and 2.6.5 is vulnerable to denial of service via regular expressions in WEBrick's Digest access authentication module. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause an effective denial of service against a WEBrick service.",
