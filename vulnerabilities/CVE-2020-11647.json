	"id": "CVE-2020-11647",
	"description": "In Wireshark 3.2.0 to 3.2.2, 3.0.0 to 3.0.9, and 2.6.0 to 2.6.15, the BACapp dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-bacapp.c by limiting the amount of recursion.\n\nA stack overflow has been found in the fAbstractSyntaxNType function of the BACApp dissector of Wireshark versions prior to 3.2.3, which could be triggered by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.",
