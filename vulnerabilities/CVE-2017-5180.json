{
	"id": "CVE-2017-5180",
	"description": "Firejail before 0.9.44.4 and 0.9.38.x LTS before 0.9.38.8 LTS does not consider the .Xauthority case during its attempt to prevent accessing user files with an euid of zero, which allows local users to conduct sandbox-escape attacks via vectors involving a symlink and the --private option.\n\nA race condition vulnerability has been discovered in firejail. An attacker that is able to symlink to arbitrary binaries or libraries can trick firejail into running them with EUID 0, resulting in escalation of privilege.",
