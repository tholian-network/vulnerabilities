	"description": "Padding bytes in Ethernet packets on PA-200, PA-220, PA-500, PA-800, PA-2000 Series, PA-3000 Series, PA-3200 Series, PA-5200 Series, and PA-7000 Series firewalls are not cleared before the data frame is created. This leaks a small amount of random information from the firewall memory into the Ethernet packets. An attacker on the same Ethernet subnet as the PAN-OS firewall is able to collect potentially sensitive information from these packets. This issue is also known as Etherleak and is detected by security scanners as CVE-2003-0001. This issue impacts: PAN-OS 8.1 version earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.18; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.12; PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.5.\n\nAffected: Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS < 8.1.18, < 9.0.12, < 9.1.5\n\nAffected: Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS 8.1.18, 9.0.12, 9.1.5, 10.0.*\n\nAffected: Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS 8.1.18, 9.0.12, 9.1.5, 10.0.*",
