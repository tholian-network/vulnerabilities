	"description": "An exploitable information disclosure vulnerability exists in the KCodes NetUSB.ko kernel module that enables the ReadySHARE Printer functionality of at least two NETGEAR Nighthawk Routers and potentially several other vendors/products. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can craft and send a packet containing an opcode that will trigger the kernel module to return several addresses. One of which can be used to calculate the dynamic base address of the module for further exploitation.\n\nAffected: Talos KCodes NETGEAR Nighthawk AC3200 (R8000) Firmware Version V1.0.4.28_10.1.54 (11/7/18) - NetUSB.ko 1.0.2.66",
