{
	"id": "CVE-2020-5206",
	"description": "In Opencast before 7.6 and 8.1, using a remember-me cookie with an arbitrary username can cause Opencast to assume proper authentication for that user even if the remember-me cookie was incorrect given that the attacked endpoint also allows anonymous access. This way, an attacker can, for example, fake a remember-me token, assume the identity of the global system administrator and request non-public content from the search service without ever providing any proper authentication. This problem is fixed in Opencast 7.6 and Opencast 8.1\n\nAffected: opencast opencast < 7.6, >= 8.0, < 8.1\n\nAffected: opencast opencast < 7.6, >= 8.0, < 8.1",
