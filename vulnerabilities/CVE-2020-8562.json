	"description": "As mitigations to a report from 2019 and CVE-2020-8555, Kubernetes attempts to prevent proxied connections from accessing link-local or localhost networks when making user-driven connections to Services, Pods, Nodes, or StorageClass service providers. As part of this mitigation Kubernetes does a DNS name resolution check and validates that response IPs are not in the link-local (169.254.0.0/16) or localhost (127.0.0.0/8) range. Kubernetes then performs a second DNS resolution without validation for the actual connection. If a non-standard DNS server returns different non-cached responses, a user may be able to bypass the proxy IP restriction and access private networks on the control plane.\n\nA security issue was discovered in Kubernetes where an authorized user may be able to access private networks on the Kubernetes control plane components. Kubernetes clusters are only affected if an untrusted user can create or modify Node objects and proxy to them, or an untrusted user can create or modify StorageClass objects and access KubeControllerManager logs.",
