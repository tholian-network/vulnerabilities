	"id": "CVE-2016-9014",
	"description": "Django before 1.8.x before 1.8.16, 1.9.x before 1.9.11, and 1.10.x before 1.10.3, when settings.DEBUG is True, allow remote attackers to conduct DNS rebinding attacks by leveraging failure to validate the HTTP Host header against settings.ALLOWED_HOSTS.\n\nOlder versions of Django don't validate the Host header against settings.ALLOWED_HOSTS when settings.DEBUG=True. This makes them vulnerable to a DNS rebinding attack.\n\nWhile Django doesn't ship a module that allows remote code execution, this is at least a cross-site scripting vector, which could be quite serious if developers load a copy of the production database in development or connect to some production services for which there's no development instance, for example. If a project uses a package like the django-debug-toolbar, then the attacker could execute arbitrary SQL, which could be especially bad if the developers connect to the database with a superuser account.\n\nsettings.ALLOWED_HOSTS is now validated regardless of DEBUG. For convenience, if ALLOWED_HOSTS is empty and DEBUG=True, the following variations of localhost are allowed ['localhost', '127.0.0.1', '::1']. If your local settings file has your production ALLOWED_HOSTS value, you must now omit it to get those fallback values.",
