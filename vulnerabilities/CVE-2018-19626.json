	"description": "In Wireshark 2.6.0 to 2.6.4 and 2.4.0 to 2.4.10, the DCOM dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-dcom.c by adding '\\0' termination.\n\nAn out-of-bounds read has been found in the DCOM dissector of Wireshark versions prior to 2.6.5, which could be triggered by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file",
