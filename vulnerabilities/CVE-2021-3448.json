{
	"id": "CVE-2021-3448",
	"description": "A security issue was found in dnsmasq before version 2.85. When configured with --server=<address>@<interface> or similar (e.g. through dbus), dnsmasq configures a fixed UDP port for all outgoing queries to the specified upstream DNS server. If an attacker is able to discover the opened port through other means (e.g. port scanning, guessing or sniffing), they would just have to guess the random transmission ID to forge a reply and get it accepted by dnsmasq. This flaw could be abused to perform a DNS Cache Poisoning attack.",
