	"description": "A privilege escalation vulnerability exists when an attacker establishes a vulnerable Netlogon secure channel connection to a domain controller, using the Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC), aka 'Netlogon Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability'.\n\nA flaw was found in the Microsoft Windows Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC), where it reuses a known, static, zero-value initialization vector (IV) in AES-CFB8 mode. This flaw allows an unauthenticated attacker to impersonate a domain-joined computer, including a domain controller, and possibly obtain domain administrator privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.",
