	"description": "If certificates that signed grub are installed into db, grub can be booted directly. It will then boot any kernel without signature validation. The booted kernel will think it was booted in secureboot mode and will implement lockdown, yet it could have been tampered. This flaw is a reintroduction of CVE-2020-15705 and only affects grub2 versions prior to 2.06 and upstream and distributions using the shim_lock mechanism.\n\nAffected: n/a grub2 Fixed in 2.06\n\nThe GRUB2 upstream reintroduced CVE-2020-15705. This refers to a distro specific flaw which upstream introduced in Grub 2.05.\r\n\r\nIf certificates that signed GRUB2 are installed into db, GRUB2 can be booted directly. It will then boot any kernel without signature validation. The booted kernel will think it was booted in Secure Boot mode and will implement lockdown, yet it could have been tampered.\r\n\r\nThis flaw only affects upstream and distributions using the shim_lock verifier.",
