	"id": "CVE-2020-29510",
	"description": "Go's encoding/xml handles XML directives in a way that causes crafted markup to mutate during round-trips through the xml.Decoder and xml.Encoder implementations. Encoding and decoding using Go's encoding/xml can introduce new structures around a maliciously crafted XML directive.\r\n\r\nAffected applications include software that relies on XML integrity for security-sensitive decisions. Prominent examples of such applications include SAML and XML-DSig implementations.",
