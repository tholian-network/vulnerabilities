	"id": "CVE-2020-25632",
	"description": "A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. The rmmod implementation allows the unloading of a module used as a dependency without checking if any other dependent module is still loaded leading to a use-after-free scenario. This could allow arbitrary code to be executed or a bypass of Secure Boot protections. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\nThe rmmod implementation for grub2 is flawed, allowing an attacker to unload a module used as a dependency without checking if any other dependent module is still loaded. This leads to a use-after-free scenario possibly allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code and by-pass Secure Boot protections.",
