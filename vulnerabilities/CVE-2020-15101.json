	"id": "CVE-2020-15101",
	"description": "In freewvs before 0.1.1, a directory structure of more than 1000 nested directories can interrupt a freewvs scan due to Python's recursion limit and os.walk(). This can be problematic in a case where an administrator scans the dirs of potentially untrusted users. This has been patched in 0.1.1.",
