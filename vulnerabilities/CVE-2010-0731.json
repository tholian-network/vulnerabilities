	"description": "The gnutls_x509_crt_get_serial function in the GnuTLS library before 1.2.1, when running on big-endian, 64-bit platforms, calls the asn1_read_value with a pointer to the wrong data type and the wrong length value, which allows remote attackers to bypass the certificate revocation list (CRL) check and cause a stack-based buffer overflow via a crafted X.509 certificate, related to extraction of a serial number.",
