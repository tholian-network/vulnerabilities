	"id": "CVE-2018-1999006",
	"description": "A exposure of sensitive information vulnerability exists in Jenkins 2.132 and earlier, 2.121.1 and earlier in Plugin.java that allows attackers to determine the date and time when a plugin HPI/JPI file was last extracted, which typically is the date of the most recent installation/upgrade.\n\nFiles indicating when a plugin JPI file was last extracted into a subdirectory of plugins/ in the Jenkins home directory were accessible via HTTP by users with Overall/Read permission before Jenkins 2.133. This allowed unauthorized users to determine the likely install date of a given plugin.",
