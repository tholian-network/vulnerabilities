Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and Mozilla engineers presume that with enough effort some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.\n\nAffected: Mozilla Firefox 63\n\nAffected: Mozilla Firefox 63",
