	"id": "CVE-2018-0018",
	"description": "On SRX Series devices during compilation of IDP policies, an attacker sending specially crafted packets may be able to bypass firewall rules, leading to information disclosure which an attacker may use to gain control of the target device or other internal devices, systems or services protected by the SRX Series device. This issue only applies to devices where IDP policies are applied to one or more rules. Customers not using IDP policies are not affected. Depending on if the IDP updates are automatic or not, as well as the interval between available updates, an attacker may have more or less success in performing reconnaissance or bypass attacks on the victim SRX Series device or protected devices. ScreenOS with IDP is not vulnerable to this issue. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 12.1X46 versions prior to 12.1X46-D60 on SRX; 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D35 on SRX; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D60 on SRX.\n\nAffected: Juniper Networks Junos OS < 12.1X46-D60, < 12.3X48-D35, < 15.1X49-D60\n\nAffected: Juniper Networks Junos OS 12.1X46-D60, 12.3X48-D35, 15.1X49-D60\n\nAffected: Juniper Networks Junos OS 12.1X46-D60, 12.3X48-D35, 15.1X49-D60",
