	"description": "Acronis Cyber Backup 12.5 and Cyber Protect 15 include an OpenSSL component that specifies an OPENSSLDIR variable as a subdirectory within C:\\jenkins_agent\\. Acronis Cyber Backup and Cyber Protect contain a privileged service that uses this OpenSSL component. Because unprivileged Windows users can create subdirectories off of the system root, a user can create the appropriate path to a specially-crafted openssl.cnf file to achieve arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges.\n\nAffected: Acronis Cyber Backup < 16363\nAffected: Acronis Cyber Protect < 24600\n\nAffected: Acronis Cyber Backup 16363\nAffected: Acronis Cyber Protect 24600\n\nAffected: Acronis Cyber Backup 16363\nAffected: Acronis Cyber Protect 24600",
