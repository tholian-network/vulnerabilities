	"id": "CVE-2021-41084",
	"description": "http4s is an open source scala interface for HTTP. In affected versions http4s is vulnerable to response-splitting or request-splitting attacks when untrusted user input is used to create any of the following fields: Header names (`Header.name`Ã¥), Header values (`Header.value`), Status reason phrases (`Status.reason`), URI paths (`Uri.Path`), URI authority registered names (`URI.RegName`) (through 0.21). This issue has been resolved in versions 0.21.30, 0.22.5, 0.23.4, and 1.0.0-M27 perform the following. As a matter of practice http4s services and client applications should sanitize any user input in the aforementioned fields before returning a request or response to the backend. The carriage return, newline, and null characters are the most threatening.\n\nAffected: http4s http4s <= 0.21.28, >= 0.22.0, < 0.22.5, >= 0.23.0, < 0.23.4, >= 1.0.0-M1, < 1.0.0-M27\n\nAffected: http4s http4s <= 0.21.28, >= 0.22.0, < 0.22.5, >= 0.23.0, < 0.23.4, >= 1.0.0-M1, < 1.0.0-M27",
