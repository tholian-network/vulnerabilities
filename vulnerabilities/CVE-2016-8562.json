	"description": "A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC CP 1543-1 (All versions < V2.0.28), SIPLUS NET CP 1543-1 (All versions < V2.0.28). Under special conditions it was possible to write SNMP variables on port 161/udp which should be read-only and should only be configured with TIA-Portal. A write to these variables could reduce the availability or cause a denial-of-service.\n\nAn improper privilege management vulnerability exists within the Siemens SIMATIC Communication Processor (CP) that allows a privileged attacker to remotely cause a denial of service.",
