	"id": "CVE-2019-5516",
	"description": "VMware ESXi (6.7 before ESXi670-201904101-SG and 6.5 before ESXi650-201903001), Workstation (15.x before 15.0.3 and 14.x before 14.1.6), Fusion (11.x before 11.0.3 and 10.x before 10.1.6) updates address an out-of-bounds vulnerability with the vertex shader functionality. Exploitation of this issue requires an attacker to have access to a virtual machine with 3D graphics enabled. Successful exploitation of this issue may lead to information disclosure or may allow attackers with normal user privileges to create a denial-of-service condition on their own VM. The workaround for this issue involves disabling the 3D-acceleration feature. This feature is not enabled by default on ESXi and is enabled by default on Workstation and Fusion.\n\nAffected: VMware ESXi 6.7 before ESXi670-201904101-SG, 6.5 before ESXi650-201903001\nAffected: VMware Workstation 15.x before 15.0.3, 14.x before 14.1.6\nAffected: VMware Fusion 11.x before 11.0.3, 10.x before 10.1.6\n\nAffected: VMware ESXi < ESXi670-201904101-SG, < ESXi650-201903001\nAffected: VMware Workstation < 15.0.3, < 14.1.6\nAffected: VMware Fusion < 11.0.3, < 10.1.6\n\nAffected: VMware ESXi < ESXi670-201904101-SG, < ESXi650-201903001\nAffected: VMware Workstation < 15.0.3, < 14.1.6\nAffected: VMware Fusion < 11.0.3, < 10.1.6",
