	"id": "CVE-2022-21655",
	"description": "Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications. The envoy common router will segfault if an internal redirect selects a route configured with direct response or redirect actions. This will result in a denial of service. As a workaround turn off internal redirects if direct response entries are configured on the same listener.\n\nAffected: envoyproxy envoy < 1.18.6, >= 1.19.0, < 1.19.3, >= 1.20.0, < 1.20.2, >= 1.21.0, < 1.21.1",
