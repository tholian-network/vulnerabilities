	"id": "CVE-2021-3473",
	"description": "An internal product security audit of Lenovo XClarity Controller (XCC) discovered that the XCC configuration backup/restore password may be written to an internal XCC log buffer if Lenovo XClarity Administrator (LXCA) is used to perform the backup/restore. The backup/restore password typically exists in this internal log buffer for less than 10 minutes before being overwritten. Generating an FFDC service log will include the log buffer contents, including the backup/restore password if present. The FFDC service log is only generated when requested by a privileged XCC user and it is only accessible to the privileged XCC user that requested the file. The backup/restore password is not captured if the backup/restore is initiated directly from XCC.\n\nAffected: Lenovo XClarity Controller (XCC) < 6.00 CDI370Q, < 1.10 TGBT12Q, < 3.20 TEI378W, < 2.14 PSI338I, < 4.40 TEI3B2P\n\nAffected: Lenovo XClarity Controller (XCC) 6.00 CDI370Q, 1.10 TGBT12Q, 3.20 TEI378W, 2.14 PSI338I, 4.40 TEI3B2P\n\nAffected: Lenovo XClarity Controller (XCC) 6.00 CDI370Q, 1.10 TGBT12Q, 3.20 TEI378W, 2.14 PSI338I, 4.40 TEI3B2P",
