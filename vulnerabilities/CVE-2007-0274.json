	"description": "Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Oracle Database 9.2.0.7 and 10.1.0.5 have unknown impact and attack vectors related to (1) Export and sys.dbms_logrep_util (DB08), and (2) Oracle Streams and sys.dbms_capture_adm_internal privileges (DB09).  NOTE: Oracle has not disputed reliable researcher claims that DB08 is for a buffer overflow in the GET_OBJECT_NAME procedure in the DBMS_LOGREP_UTIL package, and DB09 is for buffer overflows in the CREATE_CAPTURE, ALTER_CAPTURE, and ABORT_TABLE_INSTANTIATION procedures in SYS.DBMS_CAPTURE_ADM_INTERNAL.",
