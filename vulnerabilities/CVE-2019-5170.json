An attacker can send a specially crafted packet to trigger the parsing of this cache file.At 0x1e87c the extracted hostname value from the xml file is used as an argument to /etc/config-tools/change_hostname hostname=<contents of hostname node> using sprintf(). This command is later executed via a call to system().",
