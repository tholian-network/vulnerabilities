{
	"id": "CVE-2021-28965",
	"description": "The REXML gem before 3.2.5 in Ruby before 2.6.7, 2.7.x before 2.7.3, and 3.x before 3.0.1 does not properly address XML round-trip issues. An incorrect document can be produced after parsing and serializing.\n\nWhen parsing and serializing a crafted XML document, the REXML gem (including the one bundled with Ruby) can create a wrong XML document whose structure is different from the original one. The impact of this issue highly depends on context, but it may lead to a vulnerability in some programs that are using REXML. The issue is fixed in version 3.2.5 of the REXML gem.",
