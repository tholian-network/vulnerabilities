	"description": "Clusters using Calico (version 3.22.1 and below), Calico Enterprise (version 3.12.0 and below), may be vulnerable to route hijacking with the floating IP feature. Due to insufficient validation, a privileged attacker may be able to set a floating IP annotation to a pod even if the feature is not enabled. This may allow the attacker to intercept and reroute traffic to their compromised pod.\n\nAffected: Tigera Calico Enterprise <= v3.12.0\nAffected: Project Calico Calico <= v3.22.1",
