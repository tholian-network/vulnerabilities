	"description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: Libraries). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u121 and 8u112; Java SE Embedded: 8u111. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS v3.0 Base Score 6.5 (Confidentiality impacts).",
