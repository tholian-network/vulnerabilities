{
	"id": "CVE-2022-29194",
	"description": "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.DeleteSessionTensor` does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.\n\nAffected: tensorflow tensorflow < 2.6.4, >= 2.7.0rc0, < 2.7.2,  >= 2.8.0rc0, < 2.8.1, >= 2.9.0rc0, < 2.9.0",
