	"description": "Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in jpc_qmfb.c in JasPer 1.900.1 and earlier allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted JPEG 2000 image.\n\nAn unrestricted stack memory use flaw was found in the way JasPer decoded JPEG 2000 image files. A specially crafted file could cause an application using JasPer to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.",
