	"description": "An FR-GV-206 issue in FreeRADIUS 2.x before 2.2.10 and 3.x before 3.0.15 allows \"DHCP - Read overflow when decoding option 63\" and a denial of service.\n\nA security issue has been found in freeradius <= 3.0.15, where the fr_dhcp_decode() function performed a strcmp() on binary data in an internal data structure, instead of checking the length of the option and doing a memcmp. A remote attacker with the ability to send packets which are accepted by the server can make the server read its memory until it reaches a zero byte or crashes, causing a denial of service.",
