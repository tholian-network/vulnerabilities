	"description": "In TensorFlow before version 2.6.0 TensorFlow and Keras can be tricked to perform arbitrary code execution when deserializing a Keras model from YAML format. The implementation uses yaml.unsafe_load which can perform arbitrary code execution on the input. Given that YAML format support requires a significant amount of work, it has been removed it for now.",
