	"id": "CVE-2007-3924",
	"description": "Argument injection vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer, when running on systems with Netscape installed and certain URIs registered, allows remote attackers to conduct cross-browser scripting attacks and execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in a -chrome argument to the navigatorurl URI, which are inserted into the command line that is created when invoking netscape.exe, a related issue to CVE-2007-3670.  NOTE: there has been debate about whether the issue is in Internet Explorer or Netscape. As of 20070713, it is CVE's opinion that IE appears to not properly delimit the URL argument when invoking Netscape; this issue could arise with other protocol handlers in IE.",
