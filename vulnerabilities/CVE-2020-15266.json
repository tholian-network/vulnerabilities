	"description": "In Tensorflow before version 2.4.0, when the boxes argument of tf.image.crop_and_resize has a very large value, the CPU kernel implementation receives it as a C++ nan floating point value. Attempting to operate on this is undefined behavior which later produces a segmentation fault.",
