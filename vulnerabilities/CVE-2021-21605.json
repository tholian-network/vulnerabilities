{
	"id": "CVE-2021-21605",
	"description": "Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier allows users with Agent/Configure permission to choose agent names that cause Jenkins to override unrelated config.xml files. If the global config.xml file is replaced, Jenkins will start up with unsafe legacy defaults after a restart. Jenkins 2.275, LTS 2.263.2 ensures that agent names are considered valid names for items to prevent this problem.",
