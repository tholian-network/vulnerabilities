	"description": "A missing authorization vulnerability in the web management interface of FatPipe WARP, IPVPN, and MPVPN software prior to versions 10.1.2r60p91 and 10.2.2r42 allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to download a configuration archive. The attacker needs to know or correctly guess the hostname of the target system since the hostname is used as part of the configuration archive file name. Older versions of FatPipe software may also be vulnerable. The FatPipe advisory identifier for this vulnerability is FPSA003.\n\nAffected: FatPipe WARP  < 10.1.2r60p91, < 10.2.2r42\nAffected: FatPipe IPVPN < 10.1.2r60p91, < 10.2.2r42\nAffected: FatPipe MPVPN < 10.1.2r60p91, < 10.2.2r42",
