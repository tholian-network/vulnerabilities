	"description": "A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled exceptions delivered after a stack switch operation via Mov SS or Pop SS instructions. During the stack switch operation, processor does not deliver interrupts and exceptions, they are delivered once the first instruction after the stack switch is executed. An unprivileged system user could use this flaw to crash the system kernel resulting in DoS. This CVE-2018-10872 was assigned due to regression of CVE-2018-8897 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.10 GA kernel. No other versions are affected by this CVE.",
