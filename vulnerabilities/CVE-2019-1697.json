	"description": "A vulnerability in the implementation of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) feature in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerabilities are due to the improper parsing of LDAP packets sent to an affected device. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted LDAP packet, using Basic Encoding Rules (BER), to be processed by an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\n\nAffected: Cisco Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software  < 9.6(4.21)\n\nAffected: Cisco Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software 9.6(4.21)\n\nAffected: Cisco Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software 9.6(4.21)",
