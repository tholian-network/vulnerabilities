	"description": "A Directory Traversal vulnerability in the web framework code of the Cisco application-hosting framework (CAF) component of the Cisco IOx application environment could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to read any file from the CAF in the virtual instance running on the affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted requests to the CAF web interface. The impacts of a successful exploit are limited to the scope of the virtual instance and do not impact the router that is hosting Cisco IOx. Cisco IOx Releases 1.0.0.0 and 1.1.0.0 are vulnerable. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCuy52302.",
