	"description": "A vulnerability has been identified in JT2Go (All versions < V13.1.0), Teamcenter Visualization (All versions < V13.1.0). Affected applications lack proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing CGM files. This could lead to a stack based buffer overflow while trying to copy to a buffer during font string handling. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.\n\nAffected: Siemens JT2Go All versions < V13.1.0\nAffected: Siemens Teamcenter Visualization All versions < V13.1.0\n\nAffected: Siemens JT2Go < V13.1.0\nAffected: Siemens Teamcenter Visualization < V13.1.0\n\nAffected: Siemens JT2Go < V13.1.0\nAffected: Siemens Teamcenter Visualization < V13.1.0",
