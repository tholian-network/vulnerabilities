	"id": "CVE-2021-23824",
	"description": "This affects the package Crow before 0.3+4. When using attributes without quotes in the template, an attacker can manipulate the input to introduce additional attributes, potentially executing code. This may lead to a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, assuming an attacker can influence the value entered into the template. If the template is used to render user-generated content, this vulnerability may escalate to a persistent XSS vulnerability.\n\nAffected: n/a Crow < 0.3+4",
