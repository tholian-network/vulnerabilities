	"description": "A flaw was found in the way samba implemented SMB1 authentication. An attacker could use this flaw to retrieve the plaintext password sent over the wire even if Kerberos authentication was required.\n\nA security issue has been found in Samba versions 3.0.0 to 4.15.1. A man in the middle attack can force the client side SMB1 code  to fall-back to plaintext or NTLM based authentication even if Kerberos authentication was requested by the user or application.",
