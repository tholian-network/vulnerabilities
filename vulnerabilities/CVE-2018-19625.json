	"description": "In Wireshark 2.6.0 to 2.6.4 and 2.4.0 to 2.4.10, the dissection engine could crash. This was addressed in epan/tvbuff_composite.c by preventing a heap-based buffer over-read.\n\nAn out-of-bounds read has been found in the dissection engine of Wireshark versions prior to 2.6.5, which could be triggered by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file",
