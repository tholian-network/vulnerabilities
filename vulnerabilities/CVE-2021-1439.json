	"id": "CVE-2021-1439",
	"description": "A vulnerability in the multicast DNS (mDNS) gateway feature of Cisco Aironet Series Access Points Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of incoming mDNS traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted mDNS packet to an affected device through a wireless network that is configured in FlexConnect local switching mode or through a wired network on a configured mDNS VLAN. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the access point (AP) to reboot, resulting in a DoS condition.",
