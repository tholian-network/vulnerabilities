{
	"id": "CVE-2019-11741",
	"description": "A compromised sandboxed content process can perform a Universal Cross-site Scripting (UXSS) attack on content from any site it can cause to be loaded in the same process. Because addons.mozilla.org and accounts.firefox.com have close ties to the Firefox product, malicious manipulation of these sites within the browser can potentially be used to modify a user's Firefox configuration. These two sites will now be isolated into their own process and not allowed to be loaded in a standard content process. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 69.",
