	"description": "A vulnerability was found in openvswitch. A limitation in the implementation of userspace packet parsing can allow a malicious user to send a specially crafted packet causing the resulting megaflow in the kernel to be too wide, potentially causing a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\nMultiple versions of Open vSwitch are vulnerable to potential problems like denial of service attacks, in which crafted network packets could cause the packet lookup to ignore network header fields from layers 3 and 4. The crafted network packet is an ordinary IPv4 or IPv6 packet with Ethernet padding length above 255 bytes. This causes the packet sanity check to abort parsing header fields after layer 2. When that situation happens, the classifier will use an unexpected set of header fields. This could cause the packet lookup to either match on unintended flows or return the default table miss action 'drop'. As a consequence, the datapath can be instructed to match on an incorrect range of packets with an action to drop them, for example. Further legit traffic could hit the cached flow preventing it to expire extending the situation. The issue is fixed in versions 2.14.2, 2.13.3, 2.12.3, 2.11.6, 2.10.7, 2.9.9, 2.8.11, 2.7.13, 2.6.10 and 2.5.12.",
