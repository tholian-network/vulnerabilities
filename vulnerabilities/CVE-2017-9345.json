{
	"id": "CVE-2017-9345",
	"description": "In Wireshark 2.2.0 to 2.2.6 and 2.0.0 to 2.0.12, the DNS dissector could go into an infinite loop. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-dns.c by trying to detect self-referencing pointers.\n\nAn issue has been found in the DNS dissector of Wireshark < 2.2.7, where an infinite loop can be triggered by injecting a malicious packet into the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.",
