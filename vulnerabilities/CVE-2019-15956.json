	"description": "A vulnerability in the web management interface of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform an unauthorized system reset on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper authorization controls for a specific URL in the web management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could have a twofold impact: the attacker could either change the administrator password, gaining privileged access, or reset the network configuration details, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition. In both scenarios, manual intervention is required to restore normal operations.",
