	"description": "Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Jon Coppeard, Milan Sreckovic, Tyson Smith, Ronald Crane, Randell Jesup, Philipp, Tooru Fujisawa, and Kan-Ru Chen reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 52 and Firefox ESR 52. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.",
