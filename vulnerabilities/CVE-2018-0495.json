	"description": "Libgcrypt before 1.7.10 and 1.8.x before 1.8.3 allows a memory-cache side-channel attack on ECDSA signatures that can be mitigated through the use of blinding during the signing process in the _gcry_ecc_ecdsa_sign function in cipher/ecc-ecdsa.c, aka the Return Of the Hidden Number Problem or ROHNP. To discover an ECDSA key, the attacker needs access to either the local machine or a different virtual machine on the same physical host.\n\nAn implementation flaw has been discovered in multiple cryptographic libraries that allows a side-channel based attacker to recover ECDSA or DSA private keys. When these cryptographic libraries use the private key to create a signature, such as for a TLS or SSH connection, they inadvertently leak information through memory caches. An unprivileged attacker running on the same machine can collect the information from a few thousand signatures and recover the value of the private key.",
