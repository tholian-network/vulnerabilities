{
	"id": "CVE-2020-25829",
	"description": "An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor before 4.3.5 where a remote attacker can cause the cached records for a given name to be updated to the ‘Bogus’ DNSSEC validation state, instead of their actual DNSSEC ‘Secure’ state, via a DNS ANY query. This results in a denial of service for installations that always validate (dnssec=validate) and for clients requesting validation when on-demand validation is enabled (dnssec=process).",
