	"description": "An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor before 4.1.18, 4.2.x before 4.2.5, and 4.3.x before 4.3.5. A remote attacker can cause the cached records for a given name to be updated to the Bogus DNSSEC validation state, instead of their actual DNSSEC Secure state, via a DNS ANY query. This results in a denial of service for installation that always validate (dnssec=validate), and for clients requesting validation when on-demand validation is enabled (dnssec=process).\n\nAn issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor before 4.3.5 where a remote attacker can cause the cached records for a given name to be updated to the ‘Bogus’ DNSSEC validation state, instead of their actual DNSSEC ‘Secure’ state, via a DNS ANY query.
