	"description": "Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier allows reading arbitrary files using the file browser for workspaces and archived artifacts by following symlinks.\n\nA security issue was found in Jenkins before version 2.275. The file browser for workspaces, archived artifacts, and $JENKINS_HOME/userContent/ follows symbolic links to locations outside the directory being browsed in Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier. This allows attackers with Job/Workspace permission and the ability to control workspace contents (e.g., with Job/Configure permission or the ability to change SCM contents) to create symbolic links that allow them to access files outside workspaces using the workspace browser.",
