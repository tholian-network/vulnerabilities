{
	"id": "CVE-2021-21602",
	"description": "A security issue was found in Jenkins before version 2.275. The file browser for workspaces, archived artifacts, and $JENKINS_HOME/userContent/ follows symbolic links to locations outside the directory being browsed in Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier. This allows attackers with Job/Workspace permission and the ability to control workspace contents (e.g., with Job/Configure permission or the ability to change SCM contents) to create symbolic links that allow them to access files outside workspaces using the workspace browser.",
