	"description": "Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier allows reading arbitrary files using the file browser for workspaces and archived artifacts by following symlinks.\n\nAffected: Jenkins project Jenkins <= 2.274, <= LTS 2.263.1\n\nA security issue was found in Jenkins before version 2.275. The file browser for workspaces, archived artifacts, and $JENKINS_HOME/userContent/ follows symbolic links to locations outside the directory being browsed in Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier. This allows attackers with Job/Workspace permission and the ability to control workspace contents (e.g., with Job/Configure permission or the ability to change SCM contents) to create symbolic links that allow them to access files outside workspaces using the workspace browser.\n\nAffected: Jenkins project Jenkins 2.274, LTS 2.263.1\n\nAffected: Jenkins project Jenkins 2.274, LTS 2.263.1",
