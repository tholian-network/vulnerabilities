	"description": "The SynAttackProtect protection in Microsoft Windows 2003 before SP1 and Windows 2000 before SP4 with Update Roll-up uses a hash of predictable data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a flood of SYN packets that produce identical hash values, which slows down the hash table lookups.",
