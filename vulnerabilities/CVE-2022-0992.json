	"id": "CVE-2022-0992",
	"description": "The SiteGround Security plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass that allows unauthenticated users to log in as administrative users due to missing identity verification on initial 2FA set-up that allows unauthenticated and unauthorized users to configure 2FA for pending accounts. Upon successful configuration, the attacker is logged in as that user without access to a username/password pair which is the expected first form of authentication. This affects versions up to, and including, 1.2.5.\n\nAffected: SiteGround SiteGround Security  <= 1.2.5\n\nAffected: SiteGround SiteGround Security 1.2.5\n\nAffected: SiteGround SiteGround Security 1.2.5",
