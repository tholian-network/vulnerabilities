Between (and including) versions 13.1RC1 and 13.1, the reset password form reveals the email address of users just by giving their username. The problem has been patched on XWiki 13.2RC1. As a workaround, it is possible to manually modify the `resetpasswordinline.vm` to perform the changes made to mitigate the vulnerability.\n\nAffected: xwiki xwiki-platform >= 13.1RC1, <= 13.1\n\nAffected: xwiki xwiki-platform >= 13.1RC1, <= 13.1",
