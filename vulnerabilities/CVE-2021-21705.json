{
	"id": "CVE-2021-21705",
	"description": "In PHP versions 7.3.x below 7.3.29, 7.4.x below 7.4.21 and 8.0.x below 8.0.8, when using URL validation functionality via filter_var() function with FILTER_VALIDATE_URL parameter, an URL with invalid password field can be accepted as valid. This can lead to the code incorrectly parsing the URL and potentially leading to other security implications - like contacting a wrong server or making a wrong access decision.\n\nA security issue was found in the php_url_parse_ex() function in PHP before versions 8.0.8 and 7.4.21, which leads to FILTER_VALIDATE_URL accepting URLs with invalid userinfo, a different issue from CVE-2020-7071.",
