	"id": "CVE-2021-33191",
	"description": "From Apache NiFi MiNiFi C++ version 0.5.0 the c2 protocol implements an \"agent-update\" command which was designed to patch the application binary. This \"patching\" command defaults to calling a trusted binary, but might be modified to an arbitrary value through a \"c2-update\" command. Said command is then executed using the same privileges as the application binary. This was addressed in version 0.10.0",
