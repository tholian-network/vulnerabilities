	"description": "Ratbag game engine, as used in products such as Dirt Track Racing, Leadfoot, and World of Outlaws Spring Cars, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a TCP packet that specifies the length of data to read and then sends a second TCP packet that contains less data than specified, which causes Ratbag to repeatedly check the socket for more data.",
