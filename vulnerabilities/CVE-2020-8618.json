	"id": "CVE-2020-8618",
	"description": "An assertion check in BIND before 9.16.4 (that is meant to prevent going beyond the end of a buffer when processing incoming data) can be incorrectly triggered by a large response during zone transfer. An attacker who is permitted to send zone data to a server via zone transfer can exploit this to intentionally trigger the assertion failure with a specially constructed zone, denying service to clients.",
