{
	"id": "CVE-2021-37677",
	"description": "In TensorFlow before version 2.6.0 the shape inference code for tf.raw_ops.Dequantize has a vulnerability that could trigger a denial of service via a segfault if an attacker provides invalid arguments. The shape inference implementation uses axis to select between two different values for minmax_rank which is then used to retrieve tensor dimensions. However, code assumes that axis can be either -1 or a value greater than -1, with no validation for the other values.",
