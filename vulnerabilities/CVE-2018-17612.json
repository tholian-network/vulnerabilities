{
	"id": "CVE-2018-17612",
	"description": "Sennheiser HeadSetup 7.3.4903 places Certification Authority (CA) certificates into the Trusted Root CA store of the local system, and publishes the private key in the SennComCCKey.pem file within the public software distribution, which allows remote attackers to spoof arbitrary web sites or software publishers for several years, even if the HeadSetup product is uninstalled. NOTE: a vulnerability-assessment approach must check all Windows systems for CA certificates with a CN of 127.0.0.1 or SennComRootCA, and determine whether those certificates are unwanted.",
