	"id": "CVE-2020-16231",
	"description": "The affected Bachmann Electronic M-Base Controllers of version MSYS v1.06.14 and later use weak cryptography to protect device passwords. Affected controllers that are actively supported include MX207, MX213, MX220, MC206, MC212, MC220, and MH230 hardware controllers, and affected end-of-life controller include MC205, MC210, MH212, ME203, CS200, MP213, MP226, MPC240, MPC265, MPC270, MPC293, MPE270, and CPC210 hardware controllers. Security Level 0 is set at default from the manufacturer, which could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to gain access to the password hashes. Security Level 4 is susceptible if an authenticated remote attacker or an unauthenticated person with physical access to the device reads and decrypts the password to conduct further attacks.\n\nAffected: Bachmann Electronic, GmbH M1 Hardware Controller MX207 < All*\nAffected: Bachmann Electronic, GmbH M1 Hardware Controller MX213 < All*\nAffected: Bachmann Electronic, GmbH M1 Hardware Controller MX220 < All*\nAffected: Bachmann Electronic, GmbH M1 Hardware Controller MC206 < All*\nAffected: Bachmann Electronic, GmbH M1 Hardware Controller MC212 < All*\nAffected: Bachmann Electronic, GmbH M1 Hardware Controller MC220 < All*\nAffected: Bachmann Electronic, GmbH M1 Hardware Controller MH230 < All*\nAffected: Bachmann Electronic, GmbH M1 Hardware Controller MC205 < All*\nAffected: Bachmann Electronic, GmbH M1 Hardware Controller MC210 < All*\nAffected: Bachmann Electronic, GmbH M1 Hardware Controller MH212 < All*\nAffected: Bachmann Electronic, GmbH M1 Hardware Controller ME203 < All*\nAffected: Bachmann Electronic, GmbH M1 Hardware Controller CS200 < All*\nAffected: Bachmann Electronic, GmbH M1 Hardware Controller MP213 < All*\nAffected: Bachmann Electronic, GmbH M1 Hardware Controller MP226 < All*\nAffected: Bachmann Electronic, GmbH M1 Hardware Controller MPC240 < All*\nAffected: Bachmann Electronic, GmbH M1 Hardware Controller MPC265 < All*\nAffected: Bachmann Electronic, GmbH M1 Hardware Controller MPC270 < All*\nAffected: Bachmann Electronic, GmbH M1 Hardware Controller MPC293 < All*\nAffected: Bachmann Electronic, GmbH M1 Hardware Controller MPE270 < All*\nAffected: Bachmann Electronic, GmbH M1 Hardware Controller CPC210 < All*",
