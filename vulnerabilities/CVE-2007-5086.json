	"id": "CVE-2007-5086",
	"description": "Kaspersky Anti-Virus (KAV) and Internet Security 7.0 build 125 do not properly validate certain parameters to System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT) and Shadow SSDT function handlers, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash) via the (1) NtUserSendInput, (2) LoadLibraryA, (3) NtOpenProcess, (4) NtOpenThread, (5) NtTerminateProcess, (6) NtUserFindWindowEx, and (7) NtUserBuildHwndList kernel SSDT hooks in kylif.sys; the (8) NtDuplicateObject (DuplicateHandle) kernel SSDT hook; and possibly other kernel SSDT hooks.  NOTE: the NtCreateSection vector is covered by CVE-2007-5043.1.  NOTE: the vendor disputes that the DuplicateHandle vector is a vulnerability in their code, stating that \"it is not an error in our code, but an obscure method for manipulating standard Windows routines to circumvent our self-defense mechanisms.\"",
