	"id": "CVE-2017-1000356",
	"description": "Jenkins versions 2.56 and earlier as well as 2.46.1 LTS and earlier are vulnerable to an issue in the Jenkins user database authentication realm: create an account if signup is enabled; or create an account if the victim is an administrator, possibly deleting the existing default admin user in the process and allowing a wide variety of impacts.\n\nMultiple Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerabilities in Jenkins allowed malicious users to perform several administrative actions by tricking a victim into opening a web page. The most notable ones:\r\n\r\nSECURITY-412: Restart Jenkins immediately, after all builds are finished, or after all plugin installations and builds are finished\r\nSECURITY-412: Schedule a downgrade of Jenkins to a previously installed version if Jenkins previously upgraded itself\r\nSECURITY-413: Install and (optionally) dynamically load any plugin present on a configured update site\r\nSECURITY-414: Remove any update site from the Jenkins configuration\r\nSECURITY-415: Change a userâ€™s API token\r\nSECURITY-416: Submit system configuration\r\nSECURITY-417: Submit global security configuration\r\nSECURITY-418, SECURITY-420: For Jenkins user database authentication realm: create an account if signup is enabled; or create an account if the victim is an administrator, possibly deleting the existing default admin user in the process\r\nSECURITY-419: Create a new agent, possibly executing arbitrary shell commands on the master node by choosing the appropriate launch method\r\nSECURITY-420: Update the node monitor data on all agents",
