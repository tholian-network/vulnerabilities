{
	"id": "CVE-2021-32797",
	"description": "In JupyterLab before version 3.1.4, untrusted notebooks can execute code on load. In particular JupyterLab doesn't sanitize the action attribute of the HTML <form> element. Using this it is possible to trigger the form validation outside of the form itself. This is a remote code execution, but requires user action to open a notebook.",
