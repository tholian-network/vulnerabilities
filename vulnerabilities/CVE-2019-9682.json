	"id": "CVE-2019-9682",
	"description": "Dahua devices with Build time before December 2019 use strong security login mode by default, but in order to be compatible with the normal login of early devices, some devices retain the weak security login mode that users can control. If the user uses a weak security login method, an attacker can monitor the device network to intercept network packets to attack the device. So it is recommended that the user disable this login method.\n\nAffected: n/a IPC-HX2XXX Series,IPC-HXXX5X4X Series,IPC-HX5842H,IPC-HX7842H,NVR 5x Series,NVR 4x Series,SD6AL Series,SD5A Series,SD1A Series,PTZ1A Series,SD50/52C Series,IPC-HDBW1320E-W Versions which Build time before December,2019",
