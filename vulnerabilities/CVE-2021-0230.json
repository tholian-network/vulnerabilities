	"description": "On Juniper Networks SRX Series devices with link aggregation (lag) configured, executing any operation that fetches Aggregated Ethernet (AE) interface statistics, including but not limited to SNMP GET requests, causes a slow kernel memory leak. If all the available memory is consumed, the traffic will be impacted and a reboot might be required. The following log can be seen if this issue happens. /kernel: rt_pfe_veto: Memory over consumed.
