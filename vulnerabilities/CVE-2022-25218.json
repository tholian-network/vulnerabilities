{
	"id": "CVE-2022-25218",
	"description": "The use of the RSA algorithm without OAEP, or any other padding scheme, in telnetd_startup, allows an unauthenticated attacker on the local area network to achieve a significant degree of control over the \"plaintext\" to which an arbitrary blob of ciphertext will be decrypted by OpenSSL's RSA_public_decrypt() function. This weakness allows the attacker to manipulate the various iterations of the telnetd startup state machine and eventually obtain a root shell on the device, by means of an exchange of crafted UDP packets. In all versions but K2 22.5.9.163 and K3C 32.1.15.93 a successful attack also requires the exploitation of a null-byte interaction error (CVE-2022-25219).\n\nAffected: n/a Phicomm Routers K2 >= 22.5.9.163, K3 >= 21.5.37.246, K3C >= 32.1.15.93, K2P >= 20.4.1.7, K2 A7 >= 22.6.506.28",
