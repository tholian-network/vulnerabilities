{
	"id": "CVE-2020-6824",
	"description": "A security issue has been found in Firefox before 75.0, where generated passwords may be identical on the same site between separate private browsing sessions. Initially, a user opens a Private Browsing Window and generates a password for a site, then closes the Private Browsing Window but leaves Firefox open. Subsequently, if the user had opened a new Private Browsing Window, revisited the same site, and generated a new password - the generated passwords would have been identical, rather than independent.",
