	"description": "The Keybase Clients for macOS and Windows before version 5.9.0 fails to properly remove exploded messages initiated by a user. This can occur if the receiving user switches to a non-chat feature and places the host in a sleep state before the sending user explodes the messages. This could lead to disclosure of sensitive information which was meant to be deleted from a userâ€™s filesystem.",
