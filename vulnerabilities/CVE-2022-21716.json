	"id": "CVE-2022-21716",
	"description": "Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications, supporting Python 3.6+. Prior to 22.2.0, Twisted SSH client and server implement is able to accept an infinite amount of data for the peer's SSH version identifier. This ends up with a buffer using all the available memory. The attach is a simple as `nc -rv localhost 22 < /dev/zero`. A patch is available in version 22.2.0. There are currently no known workarounds.\n\nThe Twisted SSH client and server implementation prior to 22.2.0 naively accepted an infinite amount of data for the peer's SSH version identifier.\r\n\r\nA malicious peer can trivially craft a request that uses all available memory and crash the server, resulting in denial of service. The attack is as simple as nc -rv localhost 22 < /dev/zero.",
