	"description": "HP Mercury Quality Center (QC) 9.2 and earlier, and possibly TestDirector, relies on cached client-side scripts to implement \"workflow\" and decisions about the \"capability\" of a user, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted use of the Open Test Architecture (OTA) API, as demonstrated by modifying (1) common.tds, (2) defects.tds, (3) manrun.tds, (4) req.tds, (5) testlab.tds, or (6) testplan.tds in %tmp%\\TD_80, and then setting the file's properties to read-only.",
