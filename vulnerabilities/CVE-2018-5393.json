	"id": "CVE-2018-5393",
	"description": "The TP-LINK EAP Controller is TP-LINK's software for remotely controlling wireless access point devices. It utilizes a Java remote method invocation (RMI) service for remote control. The RMI interface does not require any authentication before use, so it lacks user authentication for RMI service commands in EAP controller versions 2.5.3 and earlier. Remote attackers can implement deserialization attacks through the RMI protocol. Successful attacks may allow a remote attacker to remotely control the target server and execute Java functions or bytecode.\n\nAffected: TP-LINK EAP Controller <= 2.5.3\n\nAffected: TP-LINK EAP Controller 2.5.3\n\nAffected: TP-LINK EAP Controller 2.5.3",
