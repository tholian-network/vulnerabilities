	"description": "In Wireshark 2.4.0 to 2.4.1 and 2.2.0 to 2.2.9, the MBIM dissector could crash or exhaust system memory. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-mbim.c by changing the memory-allocation approach.\n\nA flaw has been discovered in wireshark before 2.4.2 in the MBIM dissector when pre sizing wmem arrays leading to resource consumption and application crash by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.",
