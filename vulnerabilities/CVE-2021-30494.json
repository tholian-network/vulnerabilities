	"description": "Multiple system services installed alongside the Razer Synapse 3 software suite perform privileged operations on entries within the Razer Chroma SDK subkey. These privileged operations consist of file name concatenation of a runtime log file that is used to store runtime log information. In other words, an attacker can create a file in an unintended directory (with some limitations).",
