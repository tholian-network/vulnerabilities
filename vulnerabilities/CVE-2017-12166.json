{
	"id": "CVE-2017-12166",
	"description": "The bounds check in the read_key() function in OpenVPN before 2.4.4 and 2.3.18 was performed after using the value, instead of before.  If 'key-method 1' is used, this allowed an attacker to send a malformed packet to trigger a stack buffer overflow.\r\nNote that 'key-method 1' has been replaced by 'key method 2' as the default in OpenVPN 2.0 (released on 2005-04-17), and explicitly deprecated in 2.4 and marked for removal in 2.5. This should limit the amount of users impacted by this issue.",
