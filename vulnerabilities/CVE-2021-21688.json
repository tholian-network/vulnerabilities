FilePath#reading(FileVisitor) does not reject any operations, allowing users to have unrestricted read access using certain operations (creating archives, #copyRecursiveTo). This allows agent processes to read and write arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system, and obtain some information about Jenkins controller file systems.",
