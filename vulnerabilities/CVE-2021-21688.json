	"description": "The agent-to-controller security check FilePath#reading(FileVisitor) in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier does not reject any operations, allowing users to have unrestricted read access using certain operations (creating archives, FilePath#copyRecursiveTo).\n\nA security issue has been found in Jenkins before version 2.319. FilePath#reading(FileVisitor) does not reject any operations, allowing users to have unrestricted read access using certain operations (creating archives, #copyRecursiveTo). This allows agent processes to read and write arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system, and obtain some information about Jenkins controller file systems.",
