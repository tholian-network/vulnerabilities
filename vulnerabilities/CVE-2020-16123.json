	"id": "CVE-2020-16123",
	"description": "An Ubuntu-specific patch in PulseAudio created a race condition where the snap policy module would fail to identify a client connection from a snap as coming from a snap if SCM_CREDENTIALS were missing, allowing the snap to connect to PulseAudio without proper confinement. This could be exploited by an attacker to expose sensitive information. Fixed in 1:13.99.3-1ubuntu2, 1:13.99.2-1ubuntu2.1, 1:13.99.1-1ubuntu3.8, 1:11.1-1ubuntu7.11, and 1:8.0-0ubuntu3.15.\n\nAffected: Canonical pulseaudio < 1:13.99.3-1ubuntu2, < 1:13.99.2-1ubuntu2.1, < 1:13.99.1-1ubuntu3.8, < 1:11.1-1ubuntu7.11, < 1:8.0-0ubuntu3.15",
