	"description": "An issue was discovered in ncurses through v6.2-1. _nc_captoinfo in captoinfo.c has a heap-based buffer overflow.\n\nThe ncurses package (tic) is susceptible to a heap-based buffer overflow on crafted input affecting the _nc_captoinfo function in captoinfo.c. When the terminfo entry-description compiler processes input, proper bounds checking was not enforced leading to this software flaw.",
