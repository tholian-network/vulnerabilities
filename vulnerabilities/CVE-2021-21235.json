	"id": "CVE-2021-21235",
	"description": "kamadak-exif is an exif parsing library written in pure Rust. In kamadak-exif version 0.5.2, there is an infinite loop in parsing crafted PNG files. Specifically, reader::read_from_container can cause an infinite loop when a crafted PNG file is given. This is fixed in version 0.5.3. No workaround is available. Applications that do not pass files with the PNG signature to Reader::read_from_container are not affected.\n\nAffected: kamadak exif-rs = 0.5.2\n\nAffected: kamadak exif-rs 0.5.2\n\nAffected: kamadak exif-rs 0.5.2",
