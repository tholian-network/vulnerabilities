	"id": "CVE-2017-2669",
	"description": "Dovecot before version 2.2.29 is vulnerable to a denial of service. When 'dict' passdb and userdb were used for user authentication, the username sent by the IMAP/POP3 client was sent through var_expand() to perform %variable expansion. Sending specially crafted %variable fields could result in excessive memory usage causing the process to crash (and restart), or excessive CPU usage causing all authentications to hang.\n\nA security issue has been found in Dovecot >= 2.2.26 and <= 2.2.28. If the \"dict\" passdb is used for authentication, the username sent by the client is passed to the var_expand() function and double expansion of %-variables is performed. A remote unauthenticated attacker could then send a specially crafted username containing %variables to cause a denial of service.",
