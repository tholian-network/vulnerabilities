{
	"id": "CVE-2020-27217",
	"description": "In Eclipse Hono version 1.3.0 and 1.4.0 the AMQP protocol adapter does not verify the size of AMQP messages received from devices. In particular, a device may send messages that are bigger than the max-message-size that the protocol adapter has indicated during link establishment. While the AMQP 1.0 protocol explicitly disallows a peer to send such messages, a hand crafted AMQP 1.0 client could exploit this behavior in order to send a message of unlimited size to the adapter, eventually causing the adapter to fail with an out of memory exception.\n\nAffected: The Eclipse Foundation Eclipse Hono 1.3.0, 1.4.0\n\nAffected: The Eclipse Foundation Eclipse Hono 1.3.0, 1.4.0",
