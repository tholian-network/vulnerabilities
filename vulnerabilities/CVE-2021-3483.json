	"description": "A flaw was found in the Nosy driver in the Linux kernel. This issue allows a device to be inserted twice into a doubly-linked list, leading to a use-after-free when one of these devices is removed. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. Versions before kernel 5.12-rc6 are affected\n\nA security issue has been found in the Linux kernel before version 5.11.12 in Linux/drivers/firewire/nosy.c. Nosy is an IEEE 1394 packet sniffer which is used for protocol analysis and in the development of IEEE 1394 drivers, applications, or firmware. Incorrect handling of elements in a doubly linked list when opening nosy devices can lead to use after free.",
