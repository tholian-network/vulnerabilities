	"id": "CVE-2019-13377",
	"description": "The implementations of SAE and EAP-pwd in hostapd and wpa_supplicant 2.x through 2.8 are vulnerable to side-channel attacks as a result of observable timing differences and cache access patterns when Brainpool curves are used. An attacker may be able to gain leaked information from a side-channel attack that can be used for full password recovery.",
