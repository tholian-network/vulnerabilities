	"description": "Datakit Software libraries CatiaV5_3dRead, CatiaV6_3dRead, Step3dRead, Ug3dReadPsr, Jt3dReadPsr modules in KeyShot Versions v10.1 and prior lack proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing PRT files. This could lead to pointer dereferences of a value obtained from an untrusted source. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.\n\nAffected: n/a Datakit Software libraries embedded in Luxion KeyShot software CatiaV5_3dRead, CatiaV6_3dRead, Step3dRead, Ug3dReadPsr, Jt3dReadPsr modules in KeyShot Versions v10.1 and prior",
