	"id": "CVE-2021-39156",
	"description": "Istio before version 1.11.1 contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability where an HTTP request with #fragment in the path may bypass Istio's URI path based authorization policies.\r\n\r\nFor instance, an Istio authorization policy denies requests sent to the URI path /user/profile. In the vulnerable versions, a request with URI path /user/profile#section1 bypasses the deny policy and routes to the backend (with the normalized URI path /user/profile%23section1), possibly leading to a security incident.",
