	"id": "CVE-2021-39156",
	"description": "Istio is an open source platform for providing a uniform way to integrate microservices, manage traffic flow across microservices, enforce policies and aggregate telemetry data. Istio 1.11.0, 1.10.3 and below, and 1.9.7 and below contain a remotely exploitable vulnerability where an HTTP request with `#fragment` in the path may bypass Istioâ€™s URI path based authorization policies. Patches are available in Istio 1.11.1, Istio 1.10.4 and Istio 1.9.8. As a work around a Lua filter may be written to normalize the path.\n\nIstio before version 1.11.1 contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability where an HTTP request with #fragment in the path may bypass Istio's URI path based authorization policies.\r\n\r\nFor instance, an Istio authorization policy denies requests sent to the URI path /user/profile. In the vulnerable versions, a request with URI path /user/profile#section1 bypasses the deny policy and routes to the backend (with the normalized URI path /user/profile%23section1), possibly leading to a security incident.",
