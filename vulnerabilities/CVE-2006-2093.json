	"id": "CVE-2006-2093",
	"description": "Nessus before 2.2.8, and 3.x before 3.0.3, allows user-assisted attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a NASL script that calls split with an invalid sep parameter.  NOTE: a design goal of the NASL language is to facilitate sharing of security tests by guaranteeing that a script \"can not do anything nasty.\"  This issue is appropriate for CVE only if Nessus users have an expectation that a split statement will not use excessive memory.",
