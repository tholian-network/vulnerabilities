	"description": "A vulnerability has been identified in Capital VSTAR (All versions), Nucleus NET (All versions < V5.2), Nucleus ReadyStart V3 (All versions < V2012.12), Nucleus Source Code (All versions), PLUSCONTROL 1st Gen (All versions). Initial Sequence Numbers (ISNs) for TCP connections are derived from an insufficiently random source. As a result, the ISN of current and future TCP connections could be predictable. An attacker could hijack existing sessions or spoof future ones.\n\nAffected: Siemens Capital VSTAR All versions\nAffected: Siemens Nucleus NET All versions < V5.2\nAffected: Siemens Nucleus ReadyStart V3 All versions < V2012.12\nAffected: Siemens Nucleus Source Code All versions\nAffected: Siemens PLUSCONTROL 1st Gen All versions",
