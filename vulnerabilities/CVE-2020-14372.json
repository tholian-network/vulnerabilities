	"id": "CVE-2020-14372",
	"description": "A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06, where it incorrectly enables the usage of the ACPI command when Secure Boot is enabled. This flaw allows an attacker with privileged access to craft a Secondary System Description Table (SSDT) containing code to overwrite the Linux kernel lockdown variable content directly into memory. The table is further loaded and executed by the kernel, defeating its Secure Boot lockdown and allowing the attacker to load unsigned code. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity, as well as system availability.\n\nGRUB2 enables the use of the command acpi even when secure boot is signaled by the firmware. An attacker with local root privileges can drop a small SSDT in /boot/efi and modify grub.cfg to instruct grub to load said SSDT. The SSDT then gets run by the kernel and it overwrites the kernel lockdown configuration enabling the attacker to load unsigned kernel modules and kexec unsigned code.",
