	"id": "CVE-2008-1856",
	"description": "plugins/maps/db_handler.php in LinPHA 1.3.3 and earlier does not require authentication for a settings action that modifies the configuration file, which allows remote attackers to conduct directory traversal attacks and execute arbitrary local files by placing directory traversal sequences into the maps_type configuration setting, and then sending a request to maps_view.php, which causes plugins/maps/map.main.class.php to use the modified configuration.",
