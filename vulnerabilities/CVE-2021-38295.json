	"description": "In Apache CouchDB, a malicious user with permission to create documents in a database is able to attach a HTML attachment to a document. If a CouchDB admin opens that attachment in a browser, e.g. via the CouchDB admin interface Fauxton, any JavaScript code embedded in that HTML attachment will be executed within the security context of that admin. A similar route is available with the already deprecated _show and _list functionality. This privilege escalation vulnerability allows an attacker to add or remove data in any database or make configuration changes. This issue affected Apache CouchDB prior to 3.1.2\n\nAffected: Apache Software Foundation Apache CouchDB < 3.1.2\nAffected: Apache Software Foundation IBM Cloudant < 8201\n\nA security issue has been found in Apache CouchDB before version 3.1.2.
