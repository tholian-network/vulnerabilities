	"id": "CVE-2021-20254",
	"description": "A flaw was found in samba. The Samba smbd file server must map Windows group identities (SIDs) into unix group ids (gids). The code that performs this had a flaw that could allow it to read data beyond the end of the array in the case where a negative cache entry had been added to the mapping cache. This could cause the calling code to return those values into the process token that stores the group membership for a user. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.\n\nA security issue has been found in all versions of the Samba file server since Samba 3.6.0. A coding error converting SIDs to gids could allow unexpected group entries in a process token. This could allow unauthorized access to files. The issue is fixed in Samba 4.14.4, 4.13.8 and 4.12.15.",
