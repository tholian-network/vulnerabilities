	"description": "On install, Dell Encryption versions prior 10.0.1 and Dell Endpoint Security Suite Enterprise versions prior 2.0.1 will overwrite and manually set the \"Minimum Password Length\" group policy object to a value of 1 on that device. This allows for users to bypass any existing policy for password length and potentially create insecure password on their device. This value is defined during the installation of the \"Encryption Management Agent\" or \"EMAgent\" application. There are no other known values modified.",
