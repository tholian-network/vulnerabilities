	"description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of the Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user. The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.",
