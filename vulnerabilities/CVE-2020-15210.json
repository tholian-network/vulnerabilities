	"id": "CVE-2020-15210",
	"description": "In tensorflow-lite before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, if a TFLite saved model uses the same tensor as both input and output of an operator, then, depending on the operator, we can observe a segmentation fault or just memory corruption. We have patched the issue in d58c96946b and will release patch releases for all versions between 1.15 and 2.3. We recommend users to upgrade to TensorFlow 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.\n\nAffected: tensorflow tensorflow < 1.15.4, >= 2.0.0, < 2.0.3, >= 2.1.0, < 2.1.2, >= 2.2.0, < 2.2.1, >= 2.3.0, < 2.3.1\n\nAffected: tensorflow tensorflow < 1.15.4, >= 2.0.0, < 2.0.3, >= 2.1.0, < 2.1.2, >= 2.2.0, < 2.2.1, >= 2.3.0, < 2.3.1",
