	"id": "CVE-2020-17541",
	"description": "libjpeg-turbo before version 2.0.4 has a stack-based buffer overflow in the \"transform\" component. A remote attacker can send a malformed jpeg file to the service and cause arbitrary code execution or denial of service of the target service.\r\n\r\nNote: according to upstream: \"Given that the buffer overrun was fully contained within the stack and did not cause a segfault or other user-visible errant behavior, and given that the lossless transformer (unlike the decompressor) is not generally exposed to arbitrary data exploits, this issue did not likely pose a security risk.",
