	"id": "CVE-2021-43815",
	"description": "Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. Grafana prior to versions 8.3.2 and 7.5.12 has a directory traversal for arbitrary .csv files. It only affects instances that have the developer testing tool called TestData DB data source enabled and configured. The vulnerability is limited in scope, and only allows access to files with the extension .csv to authenticated users only. Grafana Cloud instances have not been affected by the vulnerability. Versions 8.3.2 and 7.5.12 contain a patch for this issue. There is a workaround available for users who cannot upgrade. Running a reverse proxy in front of Grafana that normalizes the PATH of the request will mitigate the vulnerability. The proxy will have to also be able to handle url encoded paths.\n\nAffected: grafana grafana >= 8.0.0-beta3, < 8.3.2, >= 5.0.0, < 7.5.12\n\nA security issue has been found in Grafana 8 before version 8.3.2 through which authenticated users could read out arbitrary .csv files through directory traversal. The vulnerable URL path is: /api/ds/query.",
