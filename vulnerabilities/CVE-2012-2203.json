	"description": "IBM Global Security Kit (aka GSKit) before 8.0.14.22, as used in IBM Rational Directory Server, IBM Tivoli Directory Server, and other products, uses the PKCS #12 file format for certificate objects without enforcing file integrity, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof SSL servers via vectors involving insertion of an arbitrary root Certification Authority (CA) certificate.",
