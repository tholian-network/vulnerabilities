	"id": "CVE-2021-22191",
	"description": "Improper URL handling in Wireshark 3.4.0 to 3.4.3 and 3.2.0 to 3.2.11 could allow remote code execution via via packet injection or crafted capture file.\n\nAffected: The Wireshark Foundation Wireshark >=3.4.0, <3.4.4, >=3.2.0, <3.2.12\n\nA security issue has been found in Wireshark before version 3.4.4. Some fields in the Wireshark proto_tree are double-clickable and pass URLs with arbitrary schemes to the QDesktopServices::openUrl function. http and https URLs passed to this function are opened by the browser which is generally safe. For some other schemes like dav and file however, referenced files will be opened by the system's standard application associated with their file type. By preparing internet-hosted file shares and executable files, arbitrary code execution can be achieved via malicious pcap(ng) files or captured live-traffic and some user interaction.",
