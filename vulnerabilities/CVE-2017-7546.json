	"description": "PostgreSQL versions before 9.2.22, 9.3.18, 9.4.13, 9.5.8 and 9.6.4 are vulnerable to incorrect authentication flaw allowing remote attackers to gain access to database accounts with an empty password.\n\nIt was found that authenticating to a PostgreSQL database account with an empty password was possible despite libpq's refusal to send an empty password. A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to gain access to database accounts with empty passwords.",
