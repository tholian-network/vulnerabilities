	"description": "Mozilla Necko, as used in Firefox, SeaMonkey, and other applications, performs DNS prefetching of domain names contained in links within local HTML documents, which makes it easier for remote attackers to determine the network location of the application's user by logging DNS requests.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this issue, stating \"I don't think we necessarily need to worry about that case.\"",
