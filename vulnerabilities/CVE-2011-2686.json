{
	"id": "CVE-2011-2686",
	"description": "Ruby before 1.8.7-p352 does not reset the random seed upon forking, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to predict the values of random numbers by leveraging knowledge of the number sequence obtained in a different child process, a related issue to CVE-2003-0900.  NOTE: this issue exists because of a regression during Ruby 1.8.6 development.",
