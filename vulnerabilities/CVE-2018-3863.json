	"id": "CVE-2018-3863",
	"description": "On Samsung SmartThings Hub STH-ETH-250 devices with firmware version 0.20.17, the video-core process incorrectly extracts fields from a user-controlled JSON payload, leading to a buffer overflow on the stack. An attacker can send an HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability. A strcpy overflows the destination buffer, which has a size of 40 bytes. An attacker can send an arbitrarily long \"user\" value in order to exploit this vulnerability.",
