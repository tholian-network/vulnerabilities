	"id": "CVE-2020-15174",
	"description": "In Electron before versions 11.0.0-beta.1, 10.0.1, 9.3.0 or 8.5.1 the `will-navigate` event that apps use to prevent navigations to unexpected destinations as per our security recommendations can be bypassed when a sub-frame performs a top-frame navigation across sites. The issue is patched in versions 11.0.0-beta.1, 10.0.1, 9.3.0 or 8.5.1 As a workaround sandbox all your iframes using the sandbox attribute. This will prevent them creating top-frame navigations and is good practice anyway.\n\nAffected: electron electron >= 8.0.0-beta.0, < 8.5.1, >= 9.0.0-beta.0, < 9.3.0, >= 10.0.0-beta.0, < 10.0.1",
