	"id": "CVE-2020-35947",
	"description": "An issue was discovered in the PageLayer plugin before 1.1.2 for WordPress. Nearly all of the AJAX action endpoints lacked permission checks, allowing these actions to be executed by anyone authenticated on the site. This happened because nonces were used as a means of authorization, but a nonce was present in a publicly viewable page. The greatest impact was the pagelayer_save_content function that allowed pages to be modified and allowed XSS to occur.",
