	"id": "CVE-2020-27842",
	"description": "There's a flaw in openjpeg's t2 encoder in versions prior to 2.4.0. An attacker who is able to provide crafted input to be processed by openjpeg could cause a null pointer dereference. The highest impact of this flaw is to application availability.\n\nA null pointer dereference issue was found in lib/openjp2/tgt.c when a small precincts size, the option \"-TP C\" and non (0,0) grid offset are given in OpenJPEG before version 2.4.0.",
