	"description": "Use-after-free vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 through 11 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via vectors related to the CMarkup::IsConnectedToPrimaryMarkup function, as exploited in the wild in April 2014.  NOTE: this issue originally emphasized VGX.DLL, but Microsoft clarified that \"VGX.DLL does not contain the vulnerable code leveraged in this exploit. Disabling VGX.DLL is an exploit-specific workaround that provides an immediate, effective workaround to help block known attacks.\"\n\nMicrosoft Internet Explorer 6 - 11 contains a use-after-free vulnerability which can allow for arbitrary code execution or denial of service.",
