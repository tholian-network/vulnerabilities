	"id": "CVE-2017-12791",
	"description": "It has been discovered that maliciously crafted minion IDs can cause unwanted directory traversals on the salt-master. The flaw is within the minion id validation which could allow certain minions to authenticate to a master despite not having the correct credentials. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must create a salt-minion with an ID containing characters that will cause a directory traversal.",
