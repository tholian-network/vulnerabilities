	"description": "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions an attacker can craft a TFLite model that would trigger a null pointer dereference, which would result in a crash and denial of service. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/149562d49faa709ea80df1d99fc41d005b81082a/tensorflow/lite/kernels/internal/optimized/optimized_ops.h#L268-L285) unconditionally dereferences a pointer. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 15691e456c7dc9bd6be203b09765b063bf4a380c. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\nAffected: tensorflow tensorflow >= 2.5.0, < 2.5.1, >= 2.4.0, < 2.4.3, < 2.3.4\n\nIn TensorFlow before version 2.6.0 an attacker can craft a TFLite model that would trigger a null pointer dereference, which would result in a crash and denial of service. The implementation unconditionally dereferences a pointer.",
