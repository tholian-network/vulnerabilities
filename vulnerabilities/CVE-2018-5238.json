	"description": "Norton Power Eraser (prior to 5.3.0.24) and SymDiag (prior to 2.1.242) may be susceptible to a DLL Preloading vulnerability, which is a type of issue that can occur when an application looks to call a DLL for execution and an attacker provides a malicious DLL to use instead. Depending on how the application is configured, it will generally follow a specific search path to locate the DLL. The vulnerability can be exploited by a simple file write (or potentially an over-write) which results in a foreign DLL running under the context of the application.\n\nAffected: Symantec Corporation Norton Power Eraser Prior to 5.3.0.24\nAffected: Symantec Corporation SymDiag Prior to 2.1.242\n\nAffected: Symantec Corporation Norton Power Eraser < 5.3.0.24\nAffected: Symantec Corporation SymDiag < 2.1.242\n\nAffected: Symantec Corporation Norton Power Eraser < 5.3.0.24\nAffected: Symantec Corporation SymDiag < 2.1.242",
