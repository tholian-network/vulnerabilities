	"description": "Django 1.11 before 1.11.29, 2.2 before 2.2.11, and 3.0 before 3.0.4 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a tolerance parameter in GIS functions and aggregates on Oracle. By passing a suitably crafted tolerance to GIS functions and aggregates on Oracle, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL.\n\nA potential SQL injection has been found in Django before 3.0.4, via tolerance parameter in GIS functions and aggregates on Oracle.",
