	"description": "Multiple files and folders in Utimaco SecurityServer 4.20.0.4 and 4.31.1.0. are installed with Read/Write permissions for authenticated users, which allows for binaries to be manipulated by non-administrator users. Additionally, entries are made to the PATH environment variable which, in conjunction with these weak permissions, could enable an attacker to perform a DLL hijacking attack.",
