	"id": "CVE-2018-19624",
	"description": "In Wireshark 2.6.0 to 2.6.4 and 2.4.0 to 2.4.10, the PVFS dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-pvfs2.c by preventing a NULL pointer dereference.\n\nA NULL-pointer dereference has been found in the PVFS dissector of Wireshark versions prior to 2.6.5, which could be triggered by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file",
