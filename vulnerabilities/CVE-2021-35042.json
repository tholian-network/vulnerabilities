	"description": "Django 3.1.x before 3.1.13 and 3.2.x before 3.2.5 allows QuerySet.order_by SQL injection if order_by is untrusted input from a client of a web application.\n\nA security issue has been found in Django before version 3.2.5. Unsanitized user input passed to QuerySet.order_by() could bypass intended column reference validation in path marked for deprecation resulting in a potential SQL injection even if a deprecation warning is emitted. As a mitigation the strict column reference validation was restored for the duration of the deprecation period.",
