{
	"id": "CVE-2016-10128",
	"description": "Buffer overflow in the git_pkt_parse_line function in transports/smart_pkt.c in the Git Smart Protocol support in libgit2 before 0.24.6 and 0.25.x before 0.25.1 allows remote attackers to have unspecified impact via a crafted non-flush packet.\n\nEach packet line in the Git protocol is prefixed by a four-byte length of how much data will follow, which we parse in `git_pkt_parse_line`. The transmitted length can either be equal to zero in case of a flush packet or has to be at least of length four, as it also includes the encoded length itself. Not checking this may result in a buffer overflow as it directly passes the length to functions which accept a `size_t` length as parameter.\r\nThe issue is fixed by verifying that non-flush packets have at least a length of `PKT_LEN_SIZE`.",
