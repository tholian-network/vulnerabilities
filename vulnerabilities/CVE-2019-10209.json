	"description": "Postgresql, versions 11.x before 11.5, is vulnerable to a memory disclosure in cross-type comparison for hashed subplan.\n\nAn issue has been found in PostgreSQL >= 11.0 and < 11.5. In a database containing hypothetical, user-defined hash equality operators, an attacker could read arbitrary bytes of server memory. For an attack to become possible, a superuser would need to create unusual operators. It is possible for operators not purpose-crafted for attack to have the properties that enable an attack, but we are not aware of specific examples.",
