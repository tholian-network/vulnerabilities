	"id": "CVE-2020-9756",
	"description": "Patriot Viper RGB Driver 1.1 and prior exposes IOCTL and allows insufficient access control. The IOCTL Codes 0x80102050 and 0x80102054 allows a local user with low privileges to read/write 1/2/4 bytes from or to an IO port. This could be leveraged in a number of ways to ultimately run code with elevated privileges.",
