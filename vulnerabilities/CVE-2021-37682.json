	"id": "CVE-2021-37682",
	"description": "In TensorFlow before version 2.6.0 all TFLite operations that use quantization can be made to use unitialized values. For example. The issue stems from the fact that quantization.params is only valid if quantization.type is different that kTfLiteNoQuantization. However, these checks are missing in large parts of the code.",
