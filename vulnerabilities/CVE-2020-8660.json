	"description": "CNCF Envoy through 1.13.0 TLS inspector bypass. TLS inspector could have been bypassed (not recognized as a TLS client) by a client using only TLS 1.3. Because TLS extensions (SNI, ALPN) were not inspected, those connections might have been matched to a wrong filter chain, possibly bypassing some security restrictions in the process.",
