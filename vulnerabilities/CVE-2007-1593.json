	"description": "The administrative service in Symantec Veritas Volume Replicator (VVR) for Windows 3.1 through 4.3, and VVR for Unix 3.5 through 5.0, in Symantec Storage Foundation products allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and service crash) via a crafted packet to the service port (8199/tcp) that triggers a request for more memory than available, which causes the service to write to an invalid pointer.",
