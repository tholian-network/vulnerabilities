	"description": "curl 7.75.0 through 7.76.1 suffers from a use-after-free vulnerability resulting in already freed memory being used when a TLS 1.3 session ticket arrives over a connection. A malicious server can use this in rare unfortunate circumstances to potentially reach remote code execution in the client. When libcurl at run-time sets up support for TLS 1.3 session tickets on a connection using OpenSSL, it stores pointers to the transfer in-memory object for later retrieval when a session ticket arrives. If the connection is used by multiple transfers (like with a reused HTTP/1.1 connection or multiplexed HTTP/2 connection) that first transfer object might be freed before the new session is established on that connection and then the function will access a memory buffer that might be freed. When using that memory, libcurl might even call a function pointer in the object, making it possible for a remote code execution if the server could somehow manage to get crafted memory content into the correct place in memory.\n\nlibcurl before version 7.77.0 can be tricked into using already freed memory when a new TLS session is negotiated or a client certificate is requested on an existing connection. For example, this can happen when a TLS server requests a client certificate on a connection that was established without one. A malicious server can use this in rare unfortunate circumstances to potentially reach remote code execution in the client. The flaw can only happen in libcurl built to use OpenSSL.",
