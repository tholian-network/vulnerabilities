	"id": "CVE-2018-18227",
	"description": "In Wireshark 2.6.0 to 2.6.3 and 2.4.0 to 2.4.9, the MS-WSP protocol dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-mswsp.c by properly handling NULL return values.\n\nA flaw has been discovered in wireshark >= 2.6.0 and < 2.6.4 in the  MS-WSP dissector where an invalid type could lead to an assertion failure. This could be used by an attacker to crash wireshark by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.",
