	"id": "CVE-2019-1732",
	"description": "A vulnerability in the Remote Package Manager (RPM) subsystem of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker with administrator credentials to leverage a time-of-check, time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition to corrupt local variables, which could lead to arbitrary command injection. The vulnerability is due to the lack of a proper locking mechanism on critical variables that need to stay static until used. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device and issuing a set of RPM-related CLI commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary command injection. The attacker would need administrator credentials for the targeted device.\n\nAffected: Cisco Cisco NX-OS Software < 8.3(1)\n\nAffected: Cisco Cisco NX-OS Software 8.3(1)\n\nAffected: Cisco Cisco NX-OS Software 8.3(1)",
