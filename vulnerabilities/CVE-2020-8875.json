	"id": "CVE-2020-8875",
	"description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Parallels Desktop 15.1.2-47123. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the IOCTL handler. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the kernel. Was ZDI-CAN-10028.\n\nAffected: Parallels Desktop 15.1.2-47123\n\nAffected: Parallels Desktop <= 47123\n\nAffected: Parallels Desktop <= 47123",
