	"description": "When curl is instructed to download content using the metalink feature, thecontents is verified against a hash provided in the metalink XML file.The metalink XML file points out to the client how to get the same contentfrom a set of different URLs, potentially hosted by different servers and theclient can then download the file from one or several of them. In a serial orparallel manner.If one of the servers hosting the contents has been breached and the contentsof the specific file on that server is replaced with a modified payload, curlshould detect this when the hash of the file mismatches after a completeddownload. It should remove the contents and instead try getting the contentsfrom another URL. This is not done, and instead such a hash mismatch is onlymentioned in text and the potentially malicious content is kept in the file ondisk.\n\nAffected: n/a https://github.com/curl/curl curl 7.27.0  to and including 7.77.0\n\nA security issue has been found in curl before version 7.78.0. When curl is instructed to download content using the metalink feature, the contents is verified against a hash provided in the metalink XML file. The metalink XML file points out to the client how to get the same content from a set of different URLs, potentially hosted by different servers and the client can then download the file from one or several of them in a serial or parallel manner.\r\n\r\nIf one of the servers hosting the contents has been breached and the contents of the specific file on that server is replaced with a modified payload, curl should detect this when the hash of the file mismatches after a completed download. It should remove the contents and instead try getting the contents from another URL. This is not done, and instead such a hash mismatch is only mentioned in text and the potentially malicious content is kept in the file on disk. There's a risk the user doesn't notice the message and instead assumes the file is fine.\r\n\r\nThis flaw exists only in the curl tool. libcurl is not affected.",
