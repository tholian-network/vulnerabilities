	"description": "Dovecot before 2.3.13 has Improper Input Validation in lda, lmtp, and imap, leading to an application crash via a crafted email message with certain choices for ten thousand MIME parts.\n\nA security issue was discovered in dovecot version 2.3.11 up to 2.3.11.3. Mail delivery/parsing crashed when the 10 000th MIME part was message/rfc822 (or if its parent was multipart/digest). This happened due to earlier MIME parsing changes for CVE-2020-12100. Malicious senders could crash dovecot repeatedly by sending/uploading messages with more than 10 000 MIME parts. The issue is fixed in dovecot version 2.3.13.",
