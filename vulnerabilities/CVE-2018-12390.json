	"id": "CVE-2018-12390",
	"description": "Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 62 and Firefox ESR 60.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 63, Firefox ESR < 60.3, and Thunderbird < 60.3.\n\nSeveral memory safety bugs have been found in Firefox and Thunderbird versions prior to 63.0. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and Mozilla engineers presume that with enough effort some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.",
