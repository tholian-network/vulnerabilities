	"id": "CVE-2019-3557",
	"description": "The implementations of streams for bz2 and php://output improperly implemented their readImpl functions, returning -1 consistently. This behavior caused some stream functions, such as stream_get_line, to trigger an out-of-bounds read when operating on such malformed streams. The implementations were updated to return valid values consistently. This affects all supported versions of HHVM (3.30 and 3.27.4 and below).\n\nAffected: Facebook HHVM 3.30.1, 3.30.0, 3.27.5, < 3.27.5",
