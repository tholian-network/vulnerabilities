	"id": "CVE-2008-2672",
	"description": "Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in ErfurtWiki R1.02b and earlier, when register_globals is enabled, allow remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via a .. (dot dot) in the (1) ewiki_id and (2) ewiki_action parameters to fragments/css.php, and possibly the (3) id parameter to the default URI.  NOTE: the default URI is site-specific but often performs an include_once of ewiki.php.",
