	"description": "BIND 9.16.11 -> 9.16.26, 9.17.0 -> 9.18.0 and versions 9.16.11-S1 -> 9.16.26-S1 of the BIND Supported Preview Edition. Specifically crafted TCP streams can cause connections to BIND to remain in CLOSE_WAIT status for an indefinite period of time, even after the client has terminated the connection.\n\nAffected: ISC BIND Open Source Branch 9.16 9.16.11 through versions before 9.16.27, Development Branch 9.17 BIND 9.17 all versions, Open Source Branch 9.18 9.18.0, Supported Preview Branch 9.16-S 9.16.11-S through versions before 9.16.27-S\n\nISC recently discovered an issue in BIND that allows TCP connection slots to be consumed for an indefinite time frame via a specifically crafted TCP stream sent from a client. This issue is present in BIND 9.16.11 to 9.16.26 (including S editions), and 9.18.0.\r\n\r\nThis issue can only be triggered on BIND servers which have keep-response-order enabled, which is not the default configuration. The keep-response-order option is an ACL block; any hosts which are specified within it will be able to trigger this issue on affected versions. Specifically crafted TCP streams can cause connections to BIND to remain in CLOSE_WAIT status for an indefinite period of time, even after the client has terminated the connection.",
