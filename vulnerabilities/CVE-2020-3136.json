	"id": "CVE-2020-3136",
	"description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Jabber Guest could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device. The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface of the affected device does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or to access sensitive, browser-based information. This vulnerability affects Cisco Jabber Guest releases 11.1(2) and earlier.\n\nAffected: Cisco Cisco Jabber Guest before 11.1(3)",
