	"description": "Unspecified vulnerability in the 2D component in Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 21, 5.0 Update 25, 1.4.2_27, and 1.3.1_28 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.  NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the October 2010 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable researcher that this is an integer overflow in the color profile parser that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted Tag structure in a color profile.",
