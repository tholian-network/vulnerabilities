{
	"id": "CVE-2020-27618",
	"description": "The iconv function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.32 and earlier, when processing invalid multi-byte input sequences in IBM1364, IBM1371, IBM1388, IBM1390, and IBM1399 encodings, fails to advance the input state, which could lead to an infinite loop in applications, resulting in a denial of service, a different vulnerability from CVE-2016-10228.\n\nA flaw was found in glibc up to version 2.32. If an attacker provides the iconv function with invalid multi-byte input sequences in IBM1364, IBM1371, IBM1388, IBM1390, IBM1399 encodings, it fails to advance the input state, which could lead to an infinite loop in applications, resulting in a denial of service. The issue is fixed in glibc version 2.33.",
