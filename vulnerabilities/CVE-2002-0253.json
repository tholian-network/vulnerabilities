	"description": "PHP, when not configured with the \"display_errors = Off\" setting in php.ini, allows remote attackers to obtain the physical path for an include file via a trailing slash in a request to a directly accessible PHP program, which modifies the base path, causes the include directive to fail, and produces an error message that contains the path.",
