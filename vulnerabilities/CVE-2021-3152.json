	"description": "Home Assistant before 2021.1.3 does not have a protection layer that can help to prevent directory-traversal attacks against custom integrations. NOTE: the vendor's perspective is that the vulnerability itself is in custom integrations written by third parties, not in Home Assistant; however, Home Assistant does have a security update that is worthwhile in addressing this situation\n\nHome Assistant before 2021.1.3 allows attackers to obtain sensitive information because custom integrations with ../ are mishandled leading to directory-traversal.",
