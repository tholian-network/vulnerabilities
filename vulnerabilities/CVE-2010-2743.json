	"description": "The kernel-mode drivers in Microsoft Windows XP SP3 do not properly perform indexing of a function-pointer table during the loading of keyboard layouts from disk, which allows local users to gain privileges via a crafted application, as demonstrated in the wild in July 2010 by the Stuxnet worm, aka \"Win32k Keyboard Layout Vulnerability.\"  NOTE: this might be a duplicate of CVE-2010-3888 or CVE-2010-3889.",
