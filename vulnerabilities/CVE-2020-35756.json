	"description": "An issue was discovered on Libre Wireless LS9 LS1.5/p7040 devices. There is a luci_service GETPASS Configuration Password Information Leak. The luci_service daemon running on port 7777 does not require authentication to return the device configuration password in cleartext when using the GETPASS command. As such, any unauthenticated person with access to port 7777 on the device will be able to leak the user's personal device configuration password by issuing the GETPASS command.",
