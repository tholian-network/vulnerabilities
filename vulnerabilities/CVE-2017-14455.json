	"id": "CVE-2017-14455",
	"description": "On Insteon Hub 2245-222 devices with firmware version 1012, specially crafted replies received from the PubNub service can cause buffer overflows on a global section overwriting arbitrary data. An attacker should impersonate PubNub and answer an HTTPS GET request to trigger this vulnerability. A strcpy overflows the buffer insteon_pubnub.channel_ak, which has a size of 16 bytes. An attacker can send an arbitrarily long \"ak\" parameter in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nAffected: Insteon Insteon Hub 2245-222 Firmware version 1012\n\nAffected: Insteon Insteon Hub 2245-222 Firmware version 1012",
