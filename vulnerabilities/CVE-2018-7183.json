{
	"id": "CVE-2018-7183",
	"description": "Buffer overflow in the decodearr function in ntpq in ntp 4.2.8p6 through 4.2.8p10 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by leveraging an ntpq query and sending a response with a crafted array.\n\nntpq is a monitoring and control program for ntpd. decodearr() is an internal function of ntpq that is used to -- wait for it -- decode an array in a response string when formatted data is being displayed. This is a problem in affected versions of ntpq if a maliciously-altered ntpd returns an array result that will trip this bug, or if a bad actor is able to read an ntpq request on its way to a remote ntpd server and forge and send a response before the remote ntpd sends its response. It's potentially possible that the malicious data could become injectable/executable code.",
