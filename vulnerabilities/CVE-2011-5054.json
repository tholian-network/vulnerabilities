	"id": "CVE-2011-5054",
	"description": "kcheckpass passes a user-supplied argument to the pam_start function, often within a setuid environment, which allows local users to invoke any configured PAM stack, and possibly trigger unintended side effects, via an arbitrary valid PAM service name, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-4122.  NOTE: the vendor indicates that the possibility of resultant privilege escalation may be \"a bit far-fetched.\"",
