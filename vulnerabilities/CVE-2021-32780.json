	"id": "CVE-2021-32780",
	"description": "Envoy is an open source L7 proxy and communication bus designed for large modern service oriented architectures. In affected versions Envoy transitions a H/2 connection to the CLOSED state when it receives a GOAWAY frame without any streams outstanding. The connection state is transitioned to DRAINING when it receives a SETTING frame with the SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS parameter set to 0. Receiving these two frames in the same I/O event results in abnormal termination of the Envoy process due to invalid state transition from CLOSED to DRAINING. A sequence of H/2 frames delivered by an untrusted upstream server will result in Denial of Service in the presence of untrusted **upstream** servers. Envoy versions 1.19.1, 1.18.4 contain fixes to stop processing of pending H/2 frames after connection transition to the CLOSED state.\n\nEnvoy, as used by Istio before version 1.11.1, contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability where an untrusted upstream service could cause Envoy to terminate abnormally by sending the GOAWAY frame followed by the SETTINGS frame with the SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS parameter set to 0.",
