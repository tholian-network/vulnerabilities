	"id": "CVE-2020-27841",
	"description": "There's a flaw in openjpeg in versions prior to 2.4.0 in src/lib/openjp2/pi.c. When an attacker is able to provide crafted input to be processed by the openjpeg encoder, this could cause an out-of-bounds read. The greatest impact from this flaw is to application availability.\n\nAn out-of-bounds read was discovered in lib/openjp2/pi.c:623 in OpenJPEG before version 2.4.0.",
