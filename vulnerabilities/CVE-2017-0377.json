{
	"id": "CVE-2017-0377",
	"description": "Tor 0.3.x before 0.3.0.9 has a guard-selection algorithm that only considers the exit relay (not the exit relay's family), which might allow remote attackers to defeat intended anonymity properties by leveraging the existence of large families.\n\nA security issue has been found in Tor <= 0.3.0.8, which could make it easier to eavesdrop on Tor users' traffic. When choosing which guard to use for a circuit, Tor avoids using a node that is in the same family that the exit node it selected, but this check was accidentally removed in 0.3.0.",
