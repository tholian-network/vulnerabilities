	"id": "CVE-2017-9348",
	"description": "In Wireshark 2.2.0 to 2.2.6, the DOF dissector could read past the end of a buffer. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-dof.c by validating a size value.\n\nAn issue has been found in the DOF dissector of Wireshark < 2.2.7, where a heap-based out-of-bounds read can be triggered by injecting a malicious packet into the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.",
