	"description": "Confirmation forms in Drupal 7.x before 7.52 make it easier for remote authenticated users to conduct open redirect attacks via unspecified vectors.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, malicious users could construct a URL to a confirmation form that would trick users into being redirected to a 3rd party website after interacting with the form, thereby exposing the users to potential social engineering attacks.",
