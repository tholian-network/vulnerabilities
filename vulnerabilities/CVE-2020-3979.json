	"description": "InstallBuilder for Qt Windows (versions prior to 20.7.0) installers look for plugins at a predictable location at initialization time, writable by non-admin users. While those plugins are not required, they are loaded if present, which could allow an attacker to plant a malicious library which could result in code execution with the security scope of the installer.",
