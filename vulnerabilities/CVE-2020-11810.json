	"description": "An issue was discovered in OpenVPN 2.4.x before 2.4.9. An attacker can inject a data channel v2 (P_DATA_V2) packet using a victim's peer-id. Normally such packets are dropped, but if this packet arrives before the data channel crypto parameters have been initialized, the victim's connection will be dropped. This requires careful timing due to the small time window (usually within a few seconds) between the victim client connection starting and the server PUSH_REPLY response back to the client. This attack will only work if Negotiable Cipher Parameters (NCP) is in use.\n\nA security issue has been found in OpenVPN before 2.4.9, where a 'peer-id' check is not performed correctly during a small amount of time after a connection has been established. A rogue client sending a data channel packet during that time, from a different source address and with the same 'peer-id', would cause the client data to float to that new address, effectively sopping the VPN traffic of the first, legitimate client.",
