{
	"id": "CVE-2020-11810",
	"description": "A security issue has been found in OpenVPN before 2.4.9, where a 'peer-id' check is not performed correctly during a small amount of time after a connection has been established. A rogue client sending a data channel packet during that time, from a different source address and with the same 'peer-id', would cause the client data to float to that new address, effectively sopping the VPN traffic of the first, legitimate client.",
