{
	"id": "CVE-2016-9422",
	"description": "A problem has been discovered when rowspan and colspan are not at least 1. If either one of them is zero and the other is larger than 1, HTT_X and HTT_Y attributes are not set correctly resulting in a wrong calculation of maxcol or maxrow (not including colspan/rowspan). This is leading to a potentially exploitable buffer overflow.",
