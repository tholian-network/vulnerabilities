	"id": "CVE-2021-23436",
	"description": "This affects the package immer before 9.0.6. A type confusion vulnerability can lead to a bypass of CVE-2020-28477 when the user-provided keys used in the path parameter are arrays. In particular, this bypass is possible because the condition (p === \"__proto__\" || p === \"constructor\") in applyPatches_ returns false if p is ['__proto__'] (or ['constructor']). The === operator (strict equality operator) returns false if the operands have different type.",
