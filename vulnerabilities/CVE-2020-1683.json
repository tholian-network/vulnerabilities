	"description": "On Juniper Networks Junos OS devices, a specific SNMP OID poll causes a memory leak which over time leads to a kernel crash (vmcore). Prior to the kernel crash other processes might be impacted, such as failure to establish SSH connection to the device. The administrator can monitor the output of the following command to check if there is memory leak caused by this issue: user@device> show system virtual-memory | match \"pfe_ipc|kmem\" pfe_ipc 147 5K - 164352 16,32,64,8192 <-- increasing vm.kmem_map_free: 127246336 <-- decreasing pfe_ipc 0 0K - 18598 32,8192 vm.kmem_map_free: 134582272 This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS: 17.4R3; 18.1 version 18.1R3-S5 and later versions prior to 18.1R3-S10; 18.2 version 18.2R3 and later versions prior to 18.2R3-S3; 18.2X75 version 18.2X75-D420, 18.2X75-D50 and later versions prior to 18.2X75-D430, 18.2X75-D53, 18.2X75-D60; 18.3 version 18.3R3 and later versions prior to 18.3R3-S2; 18.4 version 18.4R1-S4, 18.4R2 and later versions prior to 18.4R2-S5, 18.4R3-S1; 19.1 version 19.1R2 and later versions prior to 19.1R2-S2, 19.1R3; 19.2 version 19.2R1 and later versions prior to 19.2R1-S5, 19.2R2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S5, 19.3R3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S3, 19.4R2.
