	"description": "In Go before 1.15.13 and 1.16.x before 1.16.5, some configurations of ReverseProxy (from net/http/httputil) result in a situation where an attacker is able to drop arbitrary headers.\n\nA security issue has been found in Go before version 1.16.5. ReverseProxy in net/http/httputil could be made to forward certain hop-by-hop headers, including Connection. In case the target of the ReverseProxy was itself a reverse proxy, this would let an attacker drop arbitrary headers, including those set by the ReverseProxy.Director.",
