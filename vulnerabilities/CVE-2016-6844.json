	"description": "An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX App Suite before 7.8.2-rev8. Script code within SVG files is maintained when opening such files \"in browser\" based on our Mail or Drive app. In case of \"a\" tags, this may include link targets with base64 encoded \"data\" references. Malicious script code can be executed within a user's context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface (sending mail, deleting data etc.).",
