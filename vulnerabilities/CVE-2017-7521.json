{
	"id": "CVE-2017-7521",
	"description": "OpenVPN versions before 2.4.3 and before 2.3.17 are vulnerable to remote denial-of-service due to memory exhaustion caused by memory leaks and double-free issue in extract_x509_extension().\n\nA use-after-free has been found in OpenVPN < 2.4.3. The issue is caused by extract_x509_extension() not checking the return value of ASN1_STRING_to_UTF8(), and using then freeing a memory allocation that has already been freed if it failed. The issue requires the use of the --x509-alt-username option with an x509 extension, and is very unlikely to be triggered unless the remote peer can make the local process run out of memory.",
