	"description": "In Wireshark 2.6.0 to 2.6.4, the ZigBee ZCL dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-zbee-zcl-lighting.c by preventing a divide-by-zero error.\n\nA divide-by-zero error has been found in the ZigBee ZCL dissector of Wireshark versions prior to 2.6.5, which could be triggered by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.",
