	"description": "A security issue has been found in Jenkins before version 2.319. Agent processes are able to completely bypass file path filtering by wrapping the file operation in an agent file path. This allows agent processes to read and write arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system, and obtain some information about Jenkins controller file systems.",
