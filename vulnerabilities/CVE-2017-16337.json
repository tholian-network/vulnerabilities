	"id": "CVE-2017-16337",
	"description": "On Insteon Hub 2245-222 devices with firmware version 1012, specially crafted commands sent through the PubNub service can cause a stack-based buffer overflow overwriting arbitrary data. An attacker should send an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability. At 0x9d01ef24 the value for the s_offset key is copied using strcpy to the buffer at $sp+0x2b0. This buffer is 32 bytes large, sending anything longer will cause a buffer overflow.",
