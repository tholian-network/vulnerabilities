	"description": "ConnMan (aka Connection Manager) 1.30 through 1.39 has a stack-based buffer overflow in uncompress in dnsproxy.c via NAME, RDATA, or RDLENGTH (for A or AAAA).\n\nA security issue has been found in the dnsproxy component of connman in releases 1.32 to 1.39. Unpacking of NAME and RDATA/RDLENGTH fields with TYPE A/AAAA in the uncompress function uses a memcpy with insufficient bounds checking, which can overflow a stack buffer.",
