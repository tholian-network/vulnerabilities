{
	"id": "CVE-2020-15254",
	"description": "An undefined behaviour leading to memory corruption issues has been found in the crossbeam rust crate <= 0.4.3. The \"bounded\" channel incorrectly assumes that \"Vec::from_iter\" has allocated enough capacity for the number of iterator elements. \"Vec::from_iter\" does not actually guarantee that and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of the \"bounded\" channel reconstructs \"Vec\" from the raw pointer based on the incorrect assumptions described above. This is unsound and causing deallocation with the incorrect capacity when the size allocated by \"Vec::from_iter\" differs from the number of iterator elements.",
