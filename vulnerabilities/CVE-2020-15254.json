	"id": "CVE-2020-15254",
	"description": "Crossbeam is a set of tools for concurrent programming. In crossbeam-channel before version 0.4.4, the bounded channel incorrectly assumes that `Vec::from_iter` has allocated capacity that same as the number of iterator elements. `Vec::from_iter` does not actually guarantee that and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of the `bounded` channel reconstructs `Vec` from the raw pointer based on the incorrect assumes described above. This is unsound and causing deallocation with the incorrect capacity when `Vec::from_iter` has allocated different sizes with the number of iterator elements. This has been fixed in crossbeam-channel 0.4.4.\n\nAffected: crossbeam-rs crossbeam < 0.4.4\n\nAn undefined behaviour leading to memory corruption issues has been found in the crossbeam rust crate <= 0.4.3. The \"bounded\" channel incorrectly assumes that \"Vec::from_iter\" has allocated enough capacity for the number of iterator elements. \"Vec::from_iter\" does not actually guarantee that and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of the \"bounded\" channel reconstructs \"Vec\" from the raw pointer based on the incorrect assumptions described above. This is unsound and causing deallocation with the incorrect capacity when the size allocated by \"Vec::from_iter\" differs from the number of iterator elements.",
