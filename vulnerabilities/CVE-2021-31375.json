	"description": "An Improper Input Validation vulnerability in routing process daemon (RPD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS devices configured with BGP origin validation using Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), allows an attacker to send a specific BGP update which may cause RPKI policy-checks to be bypassed.
