	"description": "Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 82 and Firefox ESR 78.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83, Firefox ESR < 78.5, and Thunderbird < 78.5.\n\nSeveral memory safety issues have been found in Firefox before 83.0 and Firefox ESR before 78.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and Mozilla presumes that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.",
