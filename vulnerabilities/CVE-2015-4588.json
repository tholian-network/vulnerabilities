	"id": "CVE-2015-4588",
	"description": "Heap-based buffer overflow in the DecodeImage function in libwmf 0.2.8.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted \"run-length count\" in an image in a WMF file.\n\nIt was discovered that libwmf did not correctly process certain WMF (Windows Metafiles) with embedded BMP images. By tricking a victim into opening a specially crafted WMF file in an application using libwmf, a remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.",
