	"id": "CVE-2022-23709",
	"description": "A flaw was discovered in Kibana in which users with Read access to the Uptime feature could modify alerting rules. A user with this privilege would be able to create new alerting rules or overwrite existing ones. However, any new or modified rules would not be enabled, and a user with this privilege could not modify alerting connectors. This effectively means that Read users could disable existing alerting rules.\n\nAffected: Elastic kibana Versions 7.7.0 through 7.17.0, and 8.0.0",
