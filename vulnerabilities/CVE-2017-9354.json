	"description": "In Wireshark 2.2.0 to 2.2.6 and 2.0.0 to 2.0.12, the RGMP dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-rgmp.c by validating an IPv4 address.\n\nAn issue has been found in the RGMP dissector of Wireshark < 2.2.7, where a NULL pointer dereference can be triggered by injecting a malicious packet into the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.",
