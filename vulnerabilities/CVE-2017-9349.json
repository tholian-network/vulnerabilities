	"description": "In Wireshark 2.2.0 to 2.2.6 and 2.0.0 to 2.0.12, the DICOM dissector has an infinite loop. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-dcm.c by validating a length value.\n\nAn issue has been found in the DICOM dissector of Wireshark < 2.2.7, where an infinite loop can be triggered by injecting a malicious packet into the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.",
