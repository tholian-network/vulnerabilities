	"description": "The eisa_eeprom_read function in the parisc isa-eeprom component (drivers/parisc/eisa_eeprom.c) in the Linux kernel before 2.6.31-rc6 allows local users to access restricted memory via a negative ppos argument, which bypasses a check that assumes that ppos is positive and causes an out-of-bounds read in the readb function.",
