	"description": "JasPer before version 2.0.12 is vulnerable to a use-after-free in the way it decodes certain JPEG 2000 image files resulting in a crash on the application using JasPer.\n\nA heap-use-after-free vulnerability has been found in jasper. The vulnerability exists in code responsible for re-encoding the decoded input image file to a J2P image. The vulnerability is caused by not setting related pointers to be null after the pointers are freed (i.e. missing Setting-Pointer-Null operations after free). The vulnerability can further cause double-free.",
