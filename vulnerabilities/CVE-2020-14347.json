	"description": "A flaw was found in the way xserver memory was not properly initialized. This could leak parts of server memory to the X client. In cases where Xorg server runs with elevated privileges, this could result in possible ASLR bypass. Xorg-server before version 1.20.9 is vulnerable.\n\nAllocation for pixmap data in AllocatePixmap() does not initialize the memory in xserver, it leads to leak uninitialize heap memory to clients. When the X server runs with elevated privileges.\r\nThis flaw can lead to ASLR bypass, which when combined with other flaws (known/unknown) could lead to lead to privilege elevation in the client.",
