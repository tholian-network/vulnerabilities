	"id": "CVE-2019-5435",
	"description": "An integer overflow in curl's URL API results in a buffer overflow in libcurl 7.62.0 to and including 7.64.1.\n\nlibcurl before 7.65.0 contains two integer overflows in the curl_url_set() function that if triggered, can lead to a too small buffer allocation and a subsequent heap buffer overflow. The flaws only exist on 32 bit architectures and require excessive string input lengths.",
