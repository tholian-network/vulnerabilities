	"description": "Multiple off-by-one errors in the (1) jpc_dec_cp_setfromcox and (2) jpc_dec_cp_setfromrgn functions in jpc/jpc_dec.c in JasPer 1.900.1 and earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted jp2 file, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.\n\nMultiple off-by-one flaws, leading to heap-based buffer overflows, were found in the way JasPer decoded JPEG 2000 files. A specially crafted file could cause an application using JasPer to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.",
