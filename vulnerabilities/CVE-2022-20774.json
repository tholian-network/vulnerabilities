	"id": "CVE-2022-20774",
	"description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco IP Phone 6800, 7800, and 8800 Series with Multiplatform Firmware could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack against a user of the web-based interface of an affected system. This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading an authenticated user of the interface to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform configuration changes on the affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.",
