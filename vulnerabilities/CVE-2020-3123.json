	"id": "CVE-2020-3123",
	"description": "A vulnerability in the Data-Loss-Prevention (DLP) module in Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software versions 0.102.1 and 0.102.0 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds read affecting users that have enabled the optional DLP feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted email file to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process crash, resulting in a denial of service condition.\n\nA denial-of-service (DoS) condition may occur when using the optional credit card data-loss-prevention (DLP) feature. Improper bounds checking of an unsigned variable resulted in an out-of-bounds read, which causes a crash.",
