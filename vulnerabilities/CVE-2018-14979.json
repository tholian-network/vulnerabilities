	"description": "The ASUS ZenFone 3 Max Android device with a build fingerprint of asus/US_Phone/ASUS_X008_1:7.0/NRD90M/US_Phone-14.14.1711.92-20171208:user/release-keys contains a pre-installed app with a package name of com.asus.loguploader (versionCode=1570000275, versionName=7.0.0.55_170515). This app contains an exported service app component named com.asus.loguploader.LogUploaderService that, when accessed with a particular action string, will write a bugreport (kernel log, logcat log, and the state of system services including the text of active notifications), Wi-Fi Passwords, and other system data to external storage (sdcard). Any app with the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission on this device can read this data from the sdcard after it has been dumped there by the com.asus.loguploader. Third-party apps are not allowed to directly create a bugreport or access the user's stored wireless network credentials.",
