	"description": "ideal_process.php in the iDEAL payment module in ViArt Shop 3.3 beta and earlier might allow remote attackers to obtain the pathname for certificate and key files via an \"iDEAL transaction\", possibly involving fopen error messages for nonexistent files, a different issue than CVE-2007-5364.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for reading certificate or key files if an installation places these files under the web document root.",
