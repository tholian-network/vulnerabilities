	"id": "CVE-2019-3814",
	"description": "It was discovered that Dovecot before versions 2.2.36.1 and 2.3.4.1 incorrectly handled client certificates. A remote attacker in possession of a valid certificate with an empty username field could possibly use this issue to impersonate other users.\n\nA vulnerability has been found in Dovecot versions prior to 2.3.4.1, allowing a remote client in possession of a trusted SSL certificate to log in as any user, in some configurations.\r\nThis affects only installations using auth_ssl_require_client_cert = yes and auth_ssl_username_from_cert = yes, and the the attacker might have access to a trusted certificate without the ssl_cert_username_field (default to commonName) set in it.",
