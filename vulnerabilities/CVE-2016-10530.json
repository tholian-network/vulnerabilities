	"id": "CVE-2016-10530",
	"description": "The airbrake module 0.3.8 and earlier defaults to sending environment variables over HTTP. Environment variables can often times contain secret keys and other sensitive values. A malicious user could be on the same network as a regular user and intercept all the secret keys the user is sending. This goes against common best practice, which is to use HTTPS.\n\nAffected: HackerOne airbrake node module <=0.3.8\n\nAffected: HackerOne airbrake node module <= 0.3.8\n\nAffected: HackerOne airbrake node module <= 0.3.8",
