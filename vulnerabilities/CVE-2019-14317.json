	"id": "CVE-2019-14317",
	"description": "wolfSSL and wolfCrypt 4.1.0 and earlier (formerly known as CyaSSL) generate biased DSA nonces. This allows a remote attacker to compute the long term private key from several hundred DSA signatures via a lattice attack. The issue occurs because dsa.c fixes two bits of the generated nonces.",
