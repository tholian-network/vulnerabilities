	"id": "CVE-2016-4484",
	"description": "The Debian initrd script for the cryptsetup package 2:1.7.3-2 and earlier allows physically proximate attackers to gain shell access via many log in attempts with an invalid password.\n\nA vulnerability in cryptsetup, concretely in the scripts that unlock the system partition when the partition is ciphered using LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) was found. The fault is caused by an incorrect handling of the password check in the script file /scripts/local-top/cryptroot. This vulnerability allows to obtain a root initramfs shell on affected systems. Attackers can copy, modify or destroy the hard disc as well as set up the network to exflitrate data.\n\nThis issue only affects downstream initrd's script rather then cryptsetup itself as for example shipped via Debian.",
