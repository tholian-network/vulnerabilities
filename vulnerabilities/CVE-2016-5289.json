	"description": "Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, Dan Minor, Tyson Smith, Jon Coppeard, Jan-Ivar Bruaroey, Jesse Ruderman, and Markus Stange reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 49. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.",
