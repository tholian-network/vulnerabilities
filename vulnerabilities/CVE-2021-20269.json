	"description": "A flaw was found in the permissions of a log file created by kexec-tools. This flaw allows a local unprivileged user to read this file and leak kernel internal information from a previous panic. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality. This flaw affects kexec-tools shipped by Fedora versions prior to 2.0.21-8 and RHEL versions prior to 2.0.20-47.\n\nA security issue was found in kexec-tools where vmcore-dmesg.txt extracted from the vmcore of a previous kernel panic is created world-readable. It is possible that this could be used to leak kernel internal information from a previous execution if it was output to the ring buffer or part of the panic backtrace. An unprivileged user with a local account can use this to extract kernel internal information resulting in an information leak.",
