	"description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco DNA Center could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information. Cisco DNA Center versions prior to 1.2.5 are affected.\n\nAffected: Cisco Cisco Digital Network Architecture Center (DNA Center)  < 1.2.5\n\nAffected: Cisco Cisco Digital Network Architecture Center (DNA Center) 1.2.5\n\nAffected: Cisco Cisco Digital Network Architecture Center (DNA Center) 1.2.5",
