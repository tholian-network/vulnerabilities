	"description": "Memory safety bugs were reported in Firefox 58 and Firefox ESR 52.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 52.7, Firefox ESR < 52.7, and Firefox < 59.\n\nVarious memory safety bugs have been found in Thunderbird < 52.7.0 and Firefox < 59.0, some of them presenting evidence of memory corruption. Mozilla presumes that with enough effort some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.",
