	"description": "A mechanism to bypass Content Security Policy (CSP) protections on sites that have a script-src policy of 'strict-dynamic' has been found in Firefox < 60.0. If a target website contains an HTML injection flaw an attacker could inject a reference to a copy of the require.js library that is part of Firefoxâ€™s Developer Tools, and then use a known technique using that library to bypass the CSP restrictions on executing injected scripts.",
