	"description": "Nextcloud Text is a collaborative document editing application that uses Markdown. A cross-site scripting vulnerability is present in versions prior to 19.0.13, 20.0.11, and 21.0.3. The Nextcloud Text application shipped with Nextcloud server used a `text/html` Content-Type when serving files to users. Due the strict Content-Security-Policy shipped with Nextcloud, this issue is not exploitable on modern browsers supporting Content-Security-Policy. The issue was fixed in versions 19.0.13, 20.0.11, and 21.0.3. As a workaround, use a browser that has support for Content-Security-Policy.\n\nAffected: nextcloud security-advisories < 19.0.13, >= 20.0.0, < 20.0.11, >= 21.0.0, < 21.0.3\n\nA cross-site scripting vulnerability is present in Nextcloud Text in versions prior to 21.0.3.
