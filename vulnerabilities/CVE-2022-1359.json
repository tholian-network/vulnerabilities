	"id": "CVE-2022-1359",
	"description": "The affected On-Premise cnMaestro is vulnerable to an arbitrary file-write through improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory inside a specific route. If an attacker supplied path traversal charters (../) as part of a filename, the server will save the file where the attacker chooses. This could allow an attacker to write any data to any file in the server.\n\nAffected: Cambium Networks cnMaestro < 3.0.3-r32, < 2.4.2-r29, < 3.0.0-r34",
