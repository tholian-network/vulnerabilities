	"description": "A flaw was found in xorg-x11-server in versions before 1.20.11. An integer underflow can occur in xserver which can lead to a local privilege escalation. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\nA security issue has been found in xorg-server before version 1.20.11 and xorg-xwayland before version 21.1.1. Insufficient checks on the lengths of the XInput extension ChangeFeedbackControl request can lead to out of bounds memory accesses in the X server. These issues can lead to privilege escalation for authorized clients on systems where the X server is running privileged.",
