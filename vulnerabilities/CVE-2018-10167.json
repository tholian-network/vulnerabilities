	"id": "CVE-2018-10167",
	"description": "The web application backup file in the TP-Link EAP Controller and Omada Controller versions 2.5.4_Windows/2.6.0_Windows is encrypted with a hard-coded cryptographic key, so anyone who knows that key and the algorithm can decrypt it. A low-privilege user could decrypt and modify the backup file in order to elevate their privileges. This is fixed in version 2.6.1_Windows.",
