	"id": "CVE-2020-10594",
	"description": "An issue was discovered in drf-jwt 1.15.x before 1.15.1. It allows attackers with access to a notionally invalidated token to obtain a new, working token via the refresh endpoint, because the blacklist protection mechanism is incompatible with the token-refresh feature. NOTE: drf-jwt is a fork of jpadilla/django-rest-framework-jwt, which is unmaintained.",
