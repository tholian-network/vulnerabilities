{
	"id": "CVE-2020-17521",
	"description": "Groovy before version 2.5.14 may create temporary directories within the OS temporary directory which is shared between all users on affected systems. Groovy will create such directories for internal use when producing Java Stubs or on behalf of user code via two extension methods for creating temporary directories. If Groovy user code uses either of these extension methods, and stores executable code in the resulting temporary directory, this can lead to local privilege escalation. If such Groovy code is making use of the temporary directory to store sensitive information, such information could be exposed or modified.",
