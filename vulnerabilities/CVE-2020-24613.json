	"id": "CVE-2020-24613",
	"description": "wolfSSL before 4.5.0 mishandles TLS 1.3 server data in the WAIT_CERT_CR state, within SanityCheckTls13MsgReceived() in tls13.c. This is an incorrect implementation of the TLS 1.3 client state machine. This allows attackers in a privileged network position to completely impersonate any TLS 1.3 servers, and read or modify potentially sensitive information between clients using the wolfSSL library and these TLS servers.",
