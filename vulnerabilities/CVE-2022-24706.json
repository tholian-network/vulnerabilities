	"description": "In Apache CouchDB prior to 3.2.2, an attacker can access an improperly secured default installation without authenticating and gain admin privileges. The CouchDB documentation has always made recommendations for properly securing an installation, including recommending using a firewall in front of all CouchDB installations.\n\nAffected: Apache Software Foundation Apache CouchDB <= 3.2.1\n\nAn attacker can access an improperly secured default installation without authenticating and gain admin privileges.\r\n\r\nCouchDB 3.2.2 and onwards will refuse to start with the former default Erlang cookie value of 'monster'. Installations that upgrade to this versions are forced to choose a different value.\r\nIn addition, all binary packages have been updated to bind epmd as well as the CouchDB distribution port to 127.0.0.1 and/or ::1 respectively.\n\nAffected: Apache Software Foundation Apache CouchDB 3.2.1\n\nApache CouchDB contains an insecure default initialization of resource vulnerability which can allow an attacker to escalate to administrative privileges.",
