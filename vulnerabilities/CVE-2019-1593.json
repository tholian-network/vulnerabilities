	"id": "CVE-2019-1593",
	"description": "A vulnerability in the Bash shell implementation for Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to escalate their privilege level by executing commands authorized to other user roles. The attacker must authenticate with valid user credentials. The vulnerability is due to the incorrect implementation of a Bash shell command that allows role-based access control (RBAC) to be bypassed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and entering a crafted command at the Bash prompt. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to escalate their privilege level by executing commands that should be restricted to other roles. For example, a dev-ops user could escalate their privilege level to admin with a successful exploit of this vulnerability.\n\nAffected: Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches < 7.0(3)I7(4)\nAffected: Cisco Nexus 3500 Platform Switches < 7.0(3)I7(4)\nAffected: Cisco Nexus 3600 Platform Switches < 7.0(3)F3(5)\nAffected: Cisco Nexus 7000 and 7700 Series Switches < 8.2(3)\nAffected: Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI Mode < 13.2(4d), < 14.0(1h)\nAffected: Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches in Standalone NX-OS Mode < 7.0(3)I4(9), < 7.0(3)I7(4)\n\nAffected: Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches 7.0(3)I7(4)\nAffected: Cisco Nexus 3500 Platform Switches 7.0(3)I7(4)\nAffected: Cisco Nexus 3600 Platform Switches 7.0(3)F3(5)\nAffected: Cisco Nexus 7000 and 7700 Series Switches 8.2(3)\nAffected: Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI Mode 13.2(4d), 14.0(1h)\nAffected: Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches in Standalone NX-OS Mode 7.0(3)I4(9), 7.0(3)I7(4)\n\nAffected: Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches 7.0(3)I7(4)\nAffected: Cisco Nexus 3500 Platform Switches 7.0(3)I7(4)\nAffected: Cisco Nexus 3600 Platform Switches 7.0(3)F3(5)\nAffected: Cisco Nexus 7000 and 7700 Series Switches 8.2(3)\nAffected: Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI Mode 13.2(4d), 14.0(1h)\nAffected: Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches in Standalone NX-OS Mode 7.0(3)I4(9), 7.0(3)I7(4)",
