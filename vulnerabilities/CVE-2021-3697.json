	"description": "A crafted JPEG image may lead the JPEG reader to underflow its data pointer, allowing user controlled data to be written in heap. To be successfully performed the attacker needs to do some triage over the heap layout and craft an image with a malicious format and payload. This vulnerability can lead to data corruption and eventual code execution or secure boot circumvention.",
