	"description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of D-Link DAP-1330 1.13B01 BETA routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of the SOAPAction HTTP header. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the device. Was ZDI-CAN-12029.\n\nAffected: D-Link DAP-1330 1.13B01 BETA",
