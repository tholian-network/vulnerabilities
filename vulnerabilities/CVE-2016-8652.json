	"id": "CVE-2016-8652",
	"description": "The auth component in Dovecot before 2.2.27, when auth-policy is configured, allows a remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) by aborting authentication without setting a username.\n\nIf the auth-policy component has been activated in Dovecot, then a remote user is able to use SASL authentication to crash the auth component. Workaround is to disable auth-policy component until a fix is in place. This can be done by commenting out all auth_policy_* settings.",
