{
	"id": "CVE-2019-12210",
	"description": "In Yubico pam-u2f 1.0.7, when configured with debug and a custom debug log file is set using debug_file, that file descriptor is not closed when a new process is spawned. This leads to the file descriptor being inherited into the child process; the child process can then read from and write to it. This can leak sensitive information and also, if written to, be used to fill the disk or plant misinformation.\n\nA file descriptor leak has been found in pam-u2f before 1.8.0. If the `debug` and `debug_file` options are set then the opened debug file will be inherited to the successfully authenticated user's process. Therefore this user can write further information to it, possibly filling up a privileged file system or manipulating the information found in the debug file.\r\nThis can leak sensitive information and also, if written to, be used to fill the disk or plant misinformation.",
