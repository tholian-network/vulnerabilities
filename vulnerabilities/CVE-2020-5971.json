	"description": "NVIDIA Virtual GPU Manager contains a vulnerability in the vGPU plugin, in which the software reads from a buffer by using buffer access mechanisms such as indexes or pointers that reference memory locations after the targeted buffer, which may lead to code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, or information disclosure. This affects vGPU version 8.x (prior to 8.4), version 9.x (prior to 9.4) and version 10.x (prior to 10.3).",
