A remote malicious user with 'client.write' and 'groups.update' can craft a SCIM query, which leaks information that allows an escalation of privileges, ultimately allowing the malicious user to gain control of UAA scopes they should not have.\n\nAffected: Cloud Foundry UAA Release (OSS) prior to 74.1.0\n\nAffected: Cloud Foundry UAA Release (OSS) < 74.1.0\n\nAffected: Cloud Foundry UAA Release (OSS) < 74.1.0",
