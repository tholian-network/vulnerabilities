	"id": "CVE-2021-31807",
	"description": "An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.15 and 5.x before 5.0.6. An integer overflow problem allows a remote server to achieve Denial of Service when delivering responses to HTTP Range requests. The issue trigger is a header that can be expected to exist in HTTP traffic without any malicious intent.\n\nDue to an incorrect input validation bug Squid before version 4.15 is vulnerable to a denial of service attack against all clients using the proxy by a trusted client making HTTP Range requests.",
