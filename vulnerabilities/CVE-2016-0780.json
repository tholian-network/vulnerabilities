An attacker could use an improper disk quota value to bypass enforcement and consume all the disk on DEAs/CELLs causing a potential denial of service for other applications.\n\nAffected: Pivotal Cloud Foundry cf-release v231 and lower, Elastic Runtime 1.5.x versions prior to 1.5.17, Elastic Runtime 1.6.x versions prior to 1.6.18",
