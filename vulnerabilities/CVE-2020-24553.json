	"description": "Go before 1.14.8 and 1.15.x before 1.15.1 allows XSS because text/html is the default for CGI/FCGI handlers that lack a Content-Type header.\n\nIn Go versions before 1.15.1 and 1.14.8 if the Content-Type header of a Handler was not explicitly set the net/http/cgi and net/http/fcgi packages would default to “text/html”, which could cause a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability if an attacker can control any part of the contents of a response.",
