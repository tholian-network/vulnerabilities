	"id": "CVE-2019-1881",
	"description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Industrial Network Director (IND) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack and perform arbitrary actions on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use a web browser and the privileges of the user to perform arbitrary actions on an affected device. For more information about CSRF attacks and potential mitigations, see Understanding Cross-Site Request Forgery Threat Vectors.\n\nAffected: Cisco Cisco Industrial Network Director  1.5(0.250)\n\nAffected: Cisco Cisco Industrial Network Director 1.5(0.250)\n\nAffected: Cisco Cisco Industrial Network Director 1.5(0.250)",
