{
	"id": "CVE-2022-24797",
	"description": "Pomerium is an identity-aware access proxy. In distributed service mode, Pomerium's Authenticate service exposes pprof debug and prometheus metrics handlers to untrusted traffic. This can leak potentially sensitive environmental information or lead to limited denial of service conditions. This issue is patched in version v0.17.1 Workarounds: Block access to `/debug` and `/metrics` paths on the authenticate service. This can be done with any L7 proxy, including Pomerium's own proxy service.\n\nAffected: pomerium pomerium >= v0.16.0, < v0.17.1\n\nAffected: pomerium pomerium >= v0.16.0, < v0.17.1",
