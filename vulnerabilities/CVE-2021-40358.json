Legitimate file operations on the web server of the affected systems do not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname. An attacker could then cause the pathname to resolve to a location outside of the restricted directory on the server and read, write or delete unexpected critical files.\n\nAffected: Siemens SIMATIC PCS 7 V8.2 All versions\nAffected: Siemens SIMATIC PCS 7 V9.0 All versions < V9.0 SP3 UC04\nAffected: Siemens SIMATIC PCS 7 V9.1 All versions < V9.1 SP1\nAffected: Siemens SIMATIC WinCC V15 and earlier All versions < V15 SP1 Update 7\nAffected: Siemens SIMATIC WinCC V16 All versions < V16 Update 5\nAffected: Siemens SIMATIC WinCC V17 All versions < V17 Update 2\nAffected: Siemens SIMATIC WinCC V7.4 All versions < V7.4 SP1 Update 19\nAffected: Siemens SIMATIC WinCC V7.5 All versions < V7.5 SP2 Update 5",
