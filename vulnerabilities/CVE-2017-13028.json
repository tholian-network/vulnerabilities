	"description": "The BOOTP parser in tcpdump before 4.9.2 has a buffer over-read in print-bootp.c:bootp_print().\n\nAn out-of-bounds read vulnerability was discovered in tcpdump's handling of BOOTP in tcpdump <= 4.9.1. An attacker could craft a malicious pcap file or send specially crafted packets to the network that would cause tcpdump to crash while processing the packet data.",
