	"id": "CVE-2021-21470",
	"description": "SAP EPM Add-in for Microsoft Office, version - 1010 and SAP EPM Add-in for SAP Analysis Office, version - 2.8, allows an authenticated attacker with user privileges to parse malicious XML files which could result in XXE-based attacks in applications that accept attacker-controlled XML configuration files. This occurs as logging service does not disable XML external entities when parsing configuration files and a successful exploit would result in limited impact on integrity and availability of the application.\n\nAffected: SAP SE SAP EPM Add-in for Microsoft Office < 1010\nAffected: SAP SE SAP EPM Add-in for SAP Analysis Office < 2.8",
