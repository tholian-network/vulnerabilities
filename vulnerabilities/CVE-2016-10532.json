	"id": "CVE-2016-10532",
	"description": "console-io is a module that allows users to implement a web console in their application. A malicious user could bypass the authentication and execute any command that the user who is running the console-io application 2.2.13 and earlier is able to run. This means that if console-io was running from root, the attacker would have full access to the system. This vulnerability exists because the console-io application does not configure socket.io to require authentication, which allows a malicious user to connect via a websocket to send commands and receive the response.\n\nAffected: HackerOne console-io node module <=2.2.13\n\nAffected: HackerOne console-io node module <= 2.2.13\n\nAffected: HackerOne console-io node module <= 2.2.13",
