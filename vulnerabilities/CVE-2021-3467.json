	"description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way Jasper versions before 2.0.26 handled component references in CDEF box in the JP2 image format decoder. A specially crafted JP2 image file could cause an application using the Jasper library to crash when opened.\n\nAffected: n/a jasper jasper 2.0.26\n\nA NULL pointer dereference security issue was reported in JasPer 2.0.25 in the JP2 decoder. The problem is related to insufficient validation of component references from CDEF boxes in the jp2_decode() function in src/libjasper/jp2/jp2_dec.c. The issue is fixed in JasPer 2.0.26.",
