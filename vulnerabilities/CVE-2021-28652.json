This allows a trusted client to trigger memory leaks that. over time, lead to a Denial of Service via an unspecified short query string. This attack is limited to clients with Cache Manager API access privilege.\n\nDue to an incorrect parser validation bug Squid before version 4.15 is vulnerable to a denial of Service attack against the Cache Manager API.",
