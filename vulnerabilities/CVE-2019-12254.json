	"id": "CVE-2019-12254",
	"description": "In multiple Tecson Tankspion and GOKs SmartBox 4 products the affected application doesn't properly restrict access to an endpoint that is responsible for saving settings, to a unauthenticated user with limited access rights. Based on the lack of adequately implemented access-control rules, by accessing a specific uniform resource locator (URL) on the web server, a malicious user is able to change the application settings without authenticating at all, which violates originally laid ACL rules.\n\nAffected: TECSON e-litro net < V6.32\nAffected: TECSON LX-Net < V6.32\nAffected: TECSON LX-Q-Net < V6.32\nAffected: GOK SmartBox 4 LAN < V6.3\nAffected: GOK SmartBox 4 LAN PRO < V6.3\n\nAffected: TECSON e-litro net V6.32\nAffected: TECSON LX-Net V6.32\nAffected: TECSON LX-Q-Net V6.32\nAffected: GOK SmartBox 4 LAN V6.3\nAffected: GOK SmartBox 4 LAN PRO V6.3\n\nAffected: TECSON e-litro net V6.32\nAffected: TECSON LX-Net V6.32\nAffected: TECSON LX-Q-Net V6.32\nAffected: GOK SmartBox 4 LAN V6.3\nAffected: GOK SmartBox 4 LAN PRO V6.3",
