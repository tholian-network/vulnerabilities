{
	"id": "CVE-2018-10562",
	"description": "An issue was discovered on Dasan GPON home routers. Command Injection can occur via the dest_host parameter in a diag_action=ping request to a GponForm/diag_Form URI. Because the router saves ping results in /tmp and transmits them to the user when the user revisits /diag.html, it's quite simple to execute commands and retrieve their output.\n\nDasan GPON Routers contain an authentication bypass vulnerability. When combined with CVE-2018-10561, exploitation can allow an attacker to perform remote code execution.",
