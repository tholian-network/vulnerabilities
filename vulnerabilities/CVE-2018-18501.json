	"description": "Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 64 and Firefox ESR 60.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 60.5, Firefox ESR < 60.5, and Firefox < 65.\n\nSeveral memory safety bugs have been found in Firefox < 65.0. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and Mozilla presumes that with enough effort some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.",
