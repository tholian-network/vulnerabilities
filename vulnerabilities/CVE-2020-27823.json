	"id": "CVE-2020-27823",
	"description": "A flaw was found in OpenJPEGâ€™s encoder. This flaw allows an attacker to pass specially crafted x,y offset input to OpenJPEG to use during encoding. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.\n\nIn openjpeg2 version 2.3.1 and prior, there is a heap buffer overflow in opj_tcd_dc_level_shift_encode() causing an out-of-bounds WRITE when crafted input is processed by the encoder and the -d option is used.",
