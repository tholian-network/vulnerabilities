	"description": "A race condition due to insecure creation of a file in a temporary directory vulnerability in PAN-OS allows for root privilege escalation from a limited linux user account. This allows an attacker who has escaped the restricted shell as a low privilege administrator, possibly by exploiting another vulnerability, to escalate privileges to become root user. This issue affects: PAN-OS 7.1 versions earlier than 7.1.26; PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than 8.1.13; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than 9.0.6; All versions of PAN-OS 8.0.\n\nAffected: Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS 8.0.*, < 7.1.26, < 8.1.13, < 9.0.6\n\nAffected: Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS 7.1.26, 8.1.13, 9.0.6, 8.0.*, 9.1.0\n\nAffected: Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS 7.1.26, 8.1.13, 9.0.6, 8.0.*, 9.1.0",
