	"id": "CVE-2022-24045",
	"description": "A vulnerability has been identified in Desigo DXR2 (All versions < V01.21.142.5-22), Desigo PXC3 (All versions < V01.21.142.4-18), Desigo PXC4 (All versions < V02.20.142.10-10884), Desigo PXC5 (All versions < V02.20.142.10-10884). The application, after a successful login, sets the session cookie on the browser via client-side JavaScript code, without applying any security attributes (such as “Secure”, “HttpOnly”, or “SameSite”). Any attempts to browse the application via unencrypted HTTP protocol would lead to the transmission of all his/her session cookies in plaintext through the network. An attacker could then be able to sniff the network and capture sensitive information.\n\nAffected: Siemens Desigo DXR2 All versions < V01.21.142.5-22\nAffected: Siemens Desigo PXC3 All versions < V01.21.142.4-18\nAffected: Siemens Desigo PXC4 All versions < V02.20.142.10-10884\nAffected: Siemens Desigo PXC5 All versions < V02.20.142.10-10884",
