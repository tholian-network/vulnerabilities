	"description": "CGI.escape_html in Ruby before 2.7.5 and 3.x before 3.0.3 has an integer overflow and resultant buffer overflow via a long string on platforms (such as Windows) where size_t and long have different numbers of bytes. This also affects the CGI gem before 0.3.1 for Ruby.\n\nA security issue has been found in Ruby before versions 3.0.3 and 2.7.5. A buffer overrun vulnerability was discovered in the cgi gem before versions 0.3.1, 0.2.1 and 0.1.1 when you pass a very large string (> 700 MB) to CGI.escape_html on a platform where long type takes 4 bytes, typically, Windows.",
