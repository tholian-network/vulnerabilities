	"id": "CVE-2020-28916",
	"description": "hw/net/e1000e_core.c in QEMU 5.0.0 has an infinite loop via an RX descriptor with a NULL buffer address.\n\nAn infinite loop issue was found in the e1000e device emulator in QEMU before version 5.2.0. The issue could occur while receiving packets via e1000e_write_packet_to_guest() routine, if the receive(RX) descriptor has NULL buffer address. A privileged guest user may use this flaw to induce a DoS scenario on the host.",
