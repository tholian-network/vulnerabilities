	"description": "The Live Bookmarks page and the PDF viewer in Firefox before 60.0 can run injected script content if a user pastes script from the clipboard into them while viewing RSS feeds or PDF files. This could allow a malicious site to socially engineer a user to copy and paste malicious script content that could then run with the context of either page but does not allow for privilege escalation.",
