	"description": "Firmware upgrade authentication bypass vulnerability was found in Dahua IPC-HDW4300S and some IP products. The vulnerability was caused by internal Debug function. This particular function was used for problem analysis and performance tuning during product development phase. It allowed the device to receive only specific data (one direction, no transmit) and therefore it was not involved in any instance of collecting user privacy data or allowing remote code execution.\n\nAffected: Dahua Technologies IPC-HDW4300S\\NVR11HS\\IPC-HFW4X00\\IPC-HDW4X00\\IPC-HDBW4X00\\IPC-HF5X00\\IPC-HFW5X00\\IPC-HDW5X00\\IPC-HDBW5X00\\NVR11HS References are as :http://www.dahuasecurity.com/annoucementsingle/security-advisory--high-risk-vulnerability-found-in-dahua-ipc-hdw4300s-and-some-ip-products_14731_231.html",
