	"description": "On BIG-IP (ASM) 14.1.0-14.1.0.5, 14.0.0-14.0.0.4, 13.0.0-13.1.1.4, and 12.1.0-12.1.4, Application logic abuse of ASM REST endpoints can lead to instability of BIG-IP system. Exploitation of this issue causes excessive memory consumption which results in the Linux kernel triggering OOM killer on arbitrary processes. The attack requires an authenticated user with role of \"Guest\" or greater privilege. Note: \"No Access\" cannot login so technically it's a role but a user with this access role cannot perform the attack.\n\nAffected: F5 BIG-IP (ASM) BIG-IP (ASM) 14.1.0-14.1.0.5, 14.0.0-14.0.0.4, 13.0.0-13.1.1.4, 12.1.0-12.1.4\n\nAffected: F5 BIG-IP (ASM) BIG-IP (ASM) 14.1.0-14.1.0.5, <= 14.0.0.4, <= 13.1.1.4, <= 12.1.4\n\nAffected: F5 BIG-IP (ASM) BIG-IP (ASM) 14.1.0-14.1.0.5, <= 14.0.0.4, <= 13.1.1.4, <= 12.1.4",
