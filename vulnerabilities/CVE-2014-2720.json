	"description": "IZArc 4.1.8 displays a file's name on the basis of a ZIP archive's Central Directory entry, but launches this file on the basis of a ZIP archive's local file header, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to conduct file-extension spoofing attacks via a modified Central Directory, as demonstrated by unintended code execution prompted by a .jpg extension in the Central Directory and a .exe extension in the local file header.",
