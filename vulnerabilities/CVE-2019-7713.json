	"id": "CVE-2019-7713",
	"description": "An issue was discovered in the Interpeak IPCOMShell TELNET server on Green Hills INTEGRITY RTOS 5.0.4. There is a heap-based buffer overflow in the function responsible for printing the shell prompt, when a custom modifier is used to display information such as a process ID, IP address, or current working directory. Modifier expansion triggers this overflow, causing memory corruption or a crash (and also leaks memory address information).",
