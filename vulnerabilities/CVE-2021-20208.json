	"description": "A flaw was found in cifs-utils in versions before 6.13. A user when mounting a krb5 CIFS file system from within a container can use Kerberos credentials of the host. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.\n\nA security issue was found in cifs-utils in versions before 6.13. When a container process causes an operation that trigger the kernel to ask a userspace for user credentials for an SMB filesystem, cifs.upcall utility may indirectly leak an information about Kerberos credentials available in the host environment and cause non-sanctioned SMB filesystem access in the container.",
