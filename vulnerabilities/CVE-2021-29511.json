	"id": "CVE-2021-29511",
	"description": "evm is a pure Rust implementation of Ethereum Virtual Machine. Prior to the patch, when executing specific EVM opcodes related to memory operations that use `evm_core::Memory::copy_large`, the `evm` crate can over-allocate memory when it is not needed, making it possible for an attacker to perform denial-of-service attack. The flaw was corrected in commit `19ade85`. Users should upgrade to `==0.21.1, ==0.23.1, ==0.24.1, ==0.25.1, >=0.26.1`. There are no workarounds. Please upgrade your `evm` crate version.\n\nAffected: rust-blockchain evm < 0.21.1, = 0.22.0, = 0.23.0, = 0.24.0, = 0.25.0\n\nAffected: rust-blockchain evm < 0.21.1, 0.22.0, 0.23.0, 0.24.0, 0.25.0\n\nAffected: rust-blockchain evm < 0.21.1, 0.22.0, 0.23.0, 0.24.0, 0.25.0",
