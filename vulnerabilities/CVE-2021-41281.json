	"description": "Synapse instances before version 1.47.1 with the media repository enabled can be tricked into downloading a file from a remote server into an arbitrary directory, potentially outside the media store directory.\r\n\r\nThe last two directories and file name of the path are chosen randomly by Synapse and cannot be controlled by an attacker, which limits the impact.\r\n\r\nHomeservers with the media repository disabled are unaffected. Homeservers configured with a federation whitelist are also unaffected.",
