	"description": "The _expand_quoted_text function in libs/Smarty_Compiler.class.php in Smarty 2.6.20 before r2797 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via vectors related to templates and (1) a dollar-sign character, aka \"php executed in templates;\" and (2) a double quoted literal string, aka a \"function injection security hole.\" NOTE: each vector affects slightly different SVN revisions.",
