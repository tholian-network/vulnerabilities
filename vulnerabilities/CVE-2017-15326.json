	"description": "DBS3900 TDD LTE V100R003C00, V100R004C10 have a weak encryption algorithm security vulnerability. DBS3900 TDD LTE supports SSL/TLS protocol negotiation using insecure encryption algorithms. If an insecure encryption algorithm is negotiated in the communication, an unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to crack the encrypted data and cause information leakage.\n\nAffected: Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.
