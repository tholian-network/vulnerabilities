{
	"id": "CVE-2021-3750",
	"description": "A DMA reentrancy issue was found in the EHCI controller emulation of QEMU. When EHCI tries to transfer the USB packets, it doesn't check if the buffer pointer is overlapped with its MMIO region. So crafted content may be written to the controller's registers and trigger actions like reset, but the device is still transferring packets. This flaw could enable a malicious guest to crash QEMU, resulting in a denial of service condition, or potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the QEMU process on the host.",
