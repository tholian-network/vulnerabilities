{
	"id": "CVE-2019-12527",
	"description": "An issue was discovered in Squid 4.0.23 through 4.7. When checking Basic Authentication with HttpHeader::getAuth, Squid uses a global buffer to store the decoded data. Squid does not check that the decoded length isn't greater than the buffer, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow with user controlled data.\n\nDue to incorrect buffer management Squid versions prior to 4.8 are vulnerable to a heap overflow and possible remote code execution attack when processing HTTP Authentication credentials.",
