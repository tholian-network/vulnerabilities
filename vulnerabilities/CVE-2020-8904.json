	"id": "CVE-2020-8904",
	"description": "An arbitrary memory overwrite vulnerability in the trusted memory of Asylo exists in versions prior to 0.6.0. As the ecall_restore function fails to validate the range of the output_len pointer, an attacker can manipulate the tmp_output_len value and write to an arbitrary location in the trusted (enclave) memory. We recommend updating Asylo to version 0.6.0 or later.\n\nAffected: Google LLC Asylo < 0.6.0\n\nAffected: Google LLC Asylo 0.6.0\n\nAffected: Google LLC Asylo 0.6.0",
