{
	"id": "CVE-2021-37649",
	"description": "In TensorFlow before version 2.6.0, the code for tf.raw_ops.UncompressElement can be made to trigger a null pointer dereference. The implementation obtains a pointer to a CompressedElement from a Variant tensor and then proceeds to dereference it for decompressing. There is no check that the Variant tensor contained a CompressedElement, so the pointer is actually nullptr.",
