	"description": "Improper access control in BlueZ may allow an unauthenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via adjacent access.\n\nAn information leak flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Bluetooth stack implementation handled initialization of stack memory when handling certain AMP packets. A remote attacker in adjacent range could use this flaw to leak small portions of stack memory on the system by sending a specially crafted AMP packets. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.",
