	"id": "CVE-2007-4429",
	"description": "Unspecified vulnerability in Skype allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (server hang) via unknown vectors related to sending long URIs, as claimed to be actively exploited on 20070817 using a \"call to a specific number.\"  NOTE: this identifier is for the en.securitylab.ru disclosure.  According to the vendor, this issue is separate from the \"sign-on issues\" that reduced Skype service on 20070817, which appears to be a site-specific problem.  As of 20070821, it is not clear whether this issue is simply a symptom of the larger sign-on problem.",
