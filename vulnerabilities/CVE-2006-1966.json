	"description": "An unspecified Fortinet product, possibly Fortinet28, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a \"small synflood\" to the SMTP port (TCP port 25), as demonstrated by a 10-microsecond wait between sending packets.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed in followup posts that suggest that a protection feature is triggering a RST.",
