	"id": "CVE-2019-6714",
	"description": "An issue was discovered in BlogEngine.NET through 3.3.6.0. A path traversal and Local File Inclusion vulnerability in PostList.ascx.cs can cause unauthenticated users to load a PostView.ascx component from a potentially untrusted location on the local filesystem. This is especially dangerous if an authenticated user uploads a PostView.ascx file using the file manager utility, which is currently allowed. This results in remote code execution for an authenticated user.",
