	"id": "CVE-2021-22897",
	"description": "A security issue has been found in curl before version 7.77.0. libcurl lets applictions specify which specific TLS ciphers to use in transfers, using the option called CURLOPT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST. The cipher selection is used for the TLS negotation when a transfer is done involving any of the TLS based transfer protocols libcurl supports, such as HTTPS, FTPS, IMAPS, POP3S, SMTPS etc.\r\n\r\nDue to a mistake in the code, the selected cipher set was stored in a single \"static\" variable in the library, which has the surprising side-effect that if an application sets up multiple concurrent transfers, the last one that sets the ciphers will accidentally control the set used by all transfers. In a worst-case scenario, this weakens transport security significantly.\r\n\r\nThis flaw can only trigger when Schannel is used, which is the native TLS library in Microsoft Windows.",
