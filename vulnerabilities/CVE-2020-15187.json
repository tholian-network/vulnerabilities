{
	"id": "CVE-2020-15187",
	"description": "In Helm before versions 2.16.11 and 3.3.2, a Helm plugin can contain duplicates of the same entry, with the last one always used. If a plugin is compromised, this lowers the level of access that an attacker needs to modify a plugin's install hooks, causing a local execution attack. To perform this attack, an attacker must have write access to the git repository or plugin archive (.tgz) while being downloaded (which can occur during a MITM attack on a non-SSL connection). This issue has been patched in Helm 2.16.11 and Helm 3.3.2. As a possible workaround make sure to install plugins using a secure connection protocol like SSL.\n\nAffected: helm helm >= 2.0.0, < 2.16.11, >= 3.0.0, < 3.3.2\n\nAffected: helm helm >= 2.0.0, < 2.16.11, >= 3.0.0, < 3.3.2",
