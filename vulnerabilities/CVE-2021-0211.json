	"description": "An improper check for unusual or exceptional conditions in Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved Routing Protocol Daemon (RPD) service allows an attacker to send a valid BGP FlowSpec message thereby causing an unexpected change in the route advertisements within the BGP FlowSpec domain leading to disruptions in network traffic causing a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Continued receipt of these update messages will cause a sustained Denial of Service condition.
