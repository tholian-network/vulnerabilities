	"id": "CVE-2022-31481",
	"description": "An unauthenticated attacker can send a specially crafted update file to the device that can overflow a buffer. This vulnerability impacts products based on HID Mercury Intelligent Controllers LP1501, LP1502, LP2500, LP4502, and EP4502 which contain firmware versions prior to 1.302 for the LP series and 1.296 for the EP series. The overflowed data can allow the attacker to manipulate the “normal” code execution to that of their choosing. An attacker with this level of access on the device can monitor all communications sent to and from this device, modify onboard relays, change configuration files, or cause the device to become unstable.\n\nAffected: LenelS2 LNL-X2210 < 1.302\nAffected: LenelS2 LNL-X2220 < 1.302\nAffected: LenelS2 LNL-X3300 < 1.302\nAffected: LenelS2 LNL-X4420 < 1.302\nAffected: LenelS2 LNL-4420 < 1.296\nAffected: LenelS2 S2-LP-1501 < 1.302\nAffected: LenelS2 S2-LP-1502 < 1.302\nAffected: LenelS2 S2-LP-2500 < 1.302\nAffected: LenelS2 S2-LP-4502 < 1.302\nAffected: HID Mercury LP1501 < 1.302\nAffected: HID Mercury LP1502 < 1.302\nAffected: HID Mercury LP2500 < 1.302\nAffected: HID Mercury LP4502 < 1.302\nAffected: HID Mercury EP4502 < 1.296",
