	"description": "An issue was discovered in WeeChat before 2.7.1 (0.3.4 to 2.7 are affected). When a new IRC message 005 is received with longer nick prefixes, a buffer overflow and possibly a crash can happen when a new mode is set for a nick.\n\nA heap-based out-of-bounds write has been found in Weechat before 2.7.1, when a new IRC message 005 is received with longer nick prefixes. It could lead to writing out of the allocated prefixes array when setting a prefix, resulting in denial of service (crash) or even arbitrary code execution.",
