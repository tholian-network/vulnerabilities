{
	"id": "CVE-2016-10045",
	"description": "The isMail transport in PHPMailer before 5.2.20 might allow remote attackers to pass extra parameters to the mail command and consequently execute arbitrary code by leveraging improper interaction between the escapeshellarg function and internal escaping performed in the mail function in PHP. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2016-10033.\n\nIt has been discovered that the first patch of the vulnerability CVE-2016-10033 in PHPMailer was incomplete and could potentially still be used by unauthenticated remote attackers to achieve remote arbitrary code execution in the context of the web server user and remotely compromise the target web application. This issue can be triggered by passing a maliciously crafted expression to the vulnerable application.",
