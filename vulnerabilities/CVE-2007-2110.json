	"description": "Unspecified vulnerability in the Core RDBMS component for Oracle Database 9.0.1.5+, 9.2.0.7, and 10.1.0.4 on Windows systems has unknown impact and attack vectors, aka DB03.  NOTE: as of 20070424, Oracle has not disputed reliable claims that DB03 occurs because RDBMS uses a NULL Discretionary Access Control List (DACL) for the Oracle process and certain shared memory sections, which allows local users to inject threads and execute arbitrary code via the OpenProcess, OpenThread, and SetThreadContext functions (DB03).",
