	"id": "CVE-2018-18226",
	"description": "In Wireshark 2.6.0 to 2.6.3, the Steam IHS Discovery dissector could consume system memory. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-steam-ihs-discovery.c by changing the memory-management approach.\n\nA flaw has been discovered in wireshark >= 2.6.0 and < 2.6.4 in the Steam IHS Discovery dissector where dynamically allocated memory was not properly freed on exception. This could be used by an attacker to crash wireshark by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.",
