	"description": "There is a flaw reported in the Linux kernel in versions before 5.9 in drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/nouveau_sgdma.c in nouveau_sgdma_create_ttm in Nouveau DRM subsystem. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker with a local account with a root privilege, can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the kernel.\n\nAffected: n/a kernel Kernel 5.9\n\nA security issue was found in the Linux kernel before version 5.9. The specific flaw exists within DRM memory management. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object.
