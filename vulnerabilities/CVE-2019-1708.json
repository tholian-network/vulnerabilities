	"description": "A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 Mobility and Multihoming Protocol (MOBIKE) feature for the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory leak or a reload of an affected device that leads to a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to the incorrect processing of certain MOBIKE packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted MOBIKE packets to an affected device to be processed. A successful exploit could cause an affected device to continuously consume memory and eventually reload, resulting in a DoS condition. The MOBIKE feature is supported only for IPv4 addresses.\n\nAffected: Cisco Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software  < 9.8.4, < 9.9.2.50, < 9.10.1.17\nAffected: Cisco Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software  < 6.2.3.12, < 6.3.0.3",
