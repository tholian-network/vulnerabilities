	"id": "CVE-2017-2653",
	"description": "A number of unused delete routes are present in CloudForms before 5.7.2.1 which can be accessed via GET requests instead of just POST requests. This could allow an attacker to bypass the protect_from_forgery XSRF protection causing the routes to be used. This attack would require additional cross-site scripting or similar attacks in order to execute.\n\nAffected: Red Hat CloudForms 5.7.2.1",
