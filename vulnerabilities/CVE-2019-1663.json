	"description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of the Cisco RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall, Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and Cisco RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied data in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious HTTP requests to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system of the affected device as a high-privilege user. RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall versions prior to 1.2.2.1 are affected. RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router versions prior to 1.0.3.45 are affected. RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router versions prior to 1.3.1.1 are affected.\n\nAffected: Cisco RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall < 1.2.2.1\nAffected: Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router < 1.0.3.45\nAffected: Cisco RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router < 1.3.1.1\n\nAffected: Cisco RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall 1.2.2.1\nAffected: Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router 1.0.3.45\nAffected: Cisco RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router 1.3.1.1\n\nAffected: Cisco RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall 1.2.2.1\nAffected: Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router 1.0.3.45\nAffected: Cisco RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router 1.3.1.1",
