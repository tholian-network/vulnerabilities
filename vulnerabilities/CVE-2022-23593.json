{
	"id": "CVE-2022-23593",
	"description": "Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The `simplifyBroadcast` function in the MLIR-TFRT infrastructure in TensorFlow is vulnerable to a segfault (hence, denial of service), if called with scalar shapes. If all shapes are scalar, then `maxRank` is 0, so we build an empty `SmallVector`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. This is the only affected version.\n\nAffected: tensorflow tensorflow >= 2.7.0, < 2.8.0\n\nAffected: tensorflow tensorflow >= 2.7.0, < 2.8.0",
