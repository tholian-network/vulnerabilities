	"description": "Zetetic Secure Tool for Recalling Important Passwords (STRIP) 0.5 and earlier for the PalmOS allows a local attacker to recover passwords via a brute force attack.  This attack is made feasible by STRIP's use of SysRandom, which is seeded by TimeGetTicks, and an implementation flaw which vastly reduces the password 'search space'.",
