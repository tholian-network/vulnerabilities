{
	"id": "CVE-2018-19351",
	"description": "Jupyter Notebook before 5.7.1 allows XSS via an untrusted notebook because nbconvert responses are considered to have the same origin as the notebook server. In other words, nbconvert endpoints can execute JavaScript with access to the server API. In notebook/nbconvert/handlers.py, NbconvertFileHandler and NbconvertPostHandler do not set a Content Security Policy to prevent this.\n\nA security issue has been found in Jupyter Notebook versions prior to 5.7.1, where untrusted javascript could be executed if malicious files could be delivered to the users system and the user takes specific actions with those malicious files. It allowed nbconvert endpoints (such as Print Preview) to render untrusted HTML and javascript with access to the notebook server.",
