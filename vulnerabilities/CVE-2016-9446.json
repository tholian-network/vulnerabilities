	"id": "CVE-2016-9446",
	"description": "The vmnc decoder in the gstreamer does not initialize the render canvas, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information as demonstrated by thumbnailing a simple 1 frame vmnc movie that does not draw to the allocated render canvas.\n\nAn information disclosure vulnerability has been discovered in the render canvas functionality of gst-plugins-bad due to the lack of initializing the returned heap area of g_malloc(). An example for the information leak would be thumbnailing a simple 1 frame vmnc movie that does not draw to the allocated render canvas at all.\nThis could be a problem for anyone using gstreamer in a server environment to provide a thumbnailing services.",
