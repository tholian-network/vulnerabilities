As a result, any registered user, such as subscriber, can leave an XSS payload in the plugin settings, which will be triggered by any user visiting them, and could allow for privilege escalation. The vendor decided to close the plugin.\n\nAffected: MooveAgency Contact Form Check Tester <= 1.0.2\n\nAffected: MooveAgency Contact Form Check Tester 1.0.2\n\nAffected: MooveAgency Contact Form Check Tester 1.0.2",
