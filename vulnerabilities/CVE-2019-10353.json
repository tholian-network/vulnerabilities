	"id": "CVE-2019-10353",
	"description": "CSRF tokens in Jenkins 2.185 and earlier, LTS 2.176.1 and earlier did not expire, thereby allowing attackers able to obtain them to bypass CSRF protection.\n\nBy default, CSRF tokens in Jenkins before 2.186 only checked user authentication and IP address. This allowed attackers able to obtain a CSRF token for another user to implement CSRF attacks as long as the victimâ€™s IP address remained unchanged.",
