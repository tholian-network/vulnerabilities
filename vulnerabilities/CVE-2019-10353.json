	"description": "CSRF tokens in Jenkins 2.185 and earlier, LTS 2.176.1 and earlier did not expire, thereby allowing attackers able to obtain them to bypass CSRF protection.\n\nAffected: Jenkins project Jenkins 2.185 and earlier, LTS 2.176.1 and earlier\n\nBy default, CSRF tokens in Jenkins before 2.186 only checked user authentication and IP address. This allowed attackers able to obtain a CSRF token for another user to implement CSRF attacks as long as the victimâ€™s IP address remained unchanged.",
