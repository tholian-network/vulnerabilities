	"id": "CVE-2017-2784",
	"description": "An exploitable free of a stack pointer vulnerability exists in the x509 certificate parsing code of ARM mbed TLS before 1.3.19, 2.x before 2.1.7, and 2.4.x before 2.4.2. A specially crafted x509 certificate, when parsed by mbed TLS library, can cause an invalid free of a stack pointer leading to a potential remote code execution. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can act as either a client or a server on a network to deliver malicious x509 certificates to vulnerable applications.\n\nA security issue has been found in mbed TLS < 2.4.2. If a malicious peer supplies a certificate with a specially crafted secp224k1 public key, then an attacker can cause the server or client to attempt to free block of memory held on stack. Depending on the platform, this could result in a Denial of Service (client crash) or potentially could be exploited to allow remote code execution with the same privileges as the host application.",
