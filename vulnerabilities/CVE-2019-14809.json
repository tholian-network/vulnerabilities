{
	"id": "CVE-2019-14809",
	"description": "net/url in Go before 1.11.13 and 1.12.x before 1.12.8 mishandles malformed hosts in URLs, leading to an authorization bypass in some applications. This is related to a Host field with a suffix appearing in neither Hostname() nor Port(), and is related to a non-numeric port number. For example, an attacker can compose a crafted javascript:// URL that results in a hostname of google.com.\n\nAn issue has been found in Go before 1.12.8, where url.Parse would accept URLs with malformed hosts, such that the Host field could have arbitrary suffixes that would appear in neither Hostname() nor Port(), allowing authorization bypasses in certain applications. Note that URLs with invalid, not numeric ports will now return an error from url.Parse.",
