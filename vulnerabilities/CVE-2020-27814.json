	"id": "CVE-2020-27814",
	"description": "A heap-buffer overflow was found in the way openjpeg2 handled certain PNG format files. An attacker could use this flaw to cause an application crash or in some cases execute arbitrary code with the permission of the user running such an application.\n\nA heap-buffer overwrite error was discovered in lib/openjp2/mqc.c in OpenJPEG before version 2.4.0. The vulnerability causes an out-of-bounds write, which may lead to remote denial of service or possibly remote code execution.",
