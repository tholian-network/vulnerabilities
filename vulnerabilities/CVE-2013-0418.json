	"description": "Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Outside In Technology component in Oracle Fusion Middleware 8.3.7 and 8.4 allows context-dependent attackers to affect availability via unknown vectors related to Outside In Filters, a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-0393.  NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the January 2013 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from an independent researcher that this is a heap-based buffer overflow in the Paradox database stream filter (vspdx.dll) that can be triggered using a table header with a crafted \"number of fields\" value.",
