This can be used to improperly influence systemd execution and possibly lead to root privilege escalation. Affected releases are systemd versions up to and including 239.\n\nA security issue has been found in systemd up to and including 239, where the use of fgets() allows an attacker to escalate privilege via a crafted service with NotifyAccess.",
