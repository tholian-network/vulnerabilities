	"description": "An exploitable vulnerability exists in the grsecurity PaX patch for the function read_kmem, in PaX from version pax-linux-4.9.8-test1 to 4.9.24-test7, grsecurity official from version grsecurity-3.1-4.9.8-201702060653 to grsecurity-3.1-4.9.24-201704252333, grsecurity unofficial from version v4.9.25-unofficialgrsec to v4.9.74-unofficialgrsec. PaX adds a temp buffer to the read_kmem function, which is never freed when an invalid address is supplied. This results in a memory leakage that can lead to a crash of the system. An attacker needs to induce a read to /dev/kmem using an invalid address to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nAffected: n/a PaX PaX pax-linux-4.9.24-test7.patch (latest version available to the public) grsecurity grsecurity-3.1-4.9.24-201704252333.patch (latest official version available to the public) v4.9.74-unofficial_grsec (latest unofficial version available to the public)",
