{
	"id": "CVE-2017-15189",
	"description": "In Wireshark 2.4.0 to 2.4.1, the DOCSIS dissector could go into an infinite loop. This was addressed in plugins/docsis/packet-docsis.c by adding decrements.\n\nAn infinite loop flaw has been discovered in wireshark before 2.4.2 in the DOCSIS dissector leading to excessive consumption of CPU resources by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.",
