	"id": "CVE-2022-23656",
	"description": "Zulip is an open source team chat app. The `main` development branch of Zulip Server from June 2021 and later is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability on the recent topics page. An attacker could maliciously craft a full name for their account and send messages to a topic with several participants; a victim who then opens an overflow tooltip including this full name on the recent topics page could trigger execution of JavaScript code controlled by the attacker. Users running a Zulip server from the main branch should upgrade from main (2022-03-01 or later) again to deploy this fix.\n\nAffected: zulip zulip >= 2021-06-03, < 2022-03-01\n\nAffected: zulip zulip >= 2021-06-03, < 2022-03-01",
