	"description": "Adobe FrameMaker version 2019.0.6 (and earlier versions) lacks proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer.

User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must open a malicious FrameMaker file.\n\nAffected: Adobe FrameMaker <= 2019.0.6, <= None\n\nAffected: Adobe FrameMaker 2019.0.6, None\n\nAffected: Adobe FrameMaker 2019.0.6, None",
