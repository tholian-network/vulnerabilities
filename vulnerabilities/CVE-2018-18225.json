	"id": "CVE-2018-18225",
	"description": "In Wireshark 2.6.0 to 2.6.3, the CoAP dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-coap.c by ensuring that the piv length is correctly computed.\n\nA flaw has been discovered in wireshark >= 2.6.0 and < 2.6.4 in the CoAP dissector where an invalid frame could lead to NULL-pointer dereference. This could be used by an attacker to crash wireshark by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.",
