	"description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernels implementation of audit rules, where a syscall can unexpectedly not be correctly not be logged by the audit subsystem\n\nA security issue was found in the Linux kernel. The open_by_handle_at syscall is not covered by the current file watch implementation of Auditd. This allows a local attacker with elevated privileges (CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH capability) to read and modify files without being noticed by the implemented Auditd file watches.\r\n\r\nThis syscall can still be audited by using the 'syscall auditing feature' by passing open_by_handle_at to it in the rule.  Existing auditing ruleset requirements generally use this mechanism.",
