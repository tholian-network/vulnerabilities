	"description": "Prosody before 0.11.9 allows Uncontrolled CPU Consumption via a flood of SSL/TLS renegotiation requests.\n\nA security issue was found in the Prosody.im XMPP server software before version 0.11.9. It was discovered that Prosody does not disable SSL/TLS renegotiation, even though this is not used in XMPP. A malicious client may flood a connection with renegotiation requests to consume excessive CPU resources on the server.",
