	"description": "PostgreSQL versions 8.4 - 9.6 are vulnerable to information leak in pg_user_mappings view which discloses foreign server passwords to any user having USAGE privilege on the associated foreign server.\n\nA security issue has been found in PostgreSQL < 9.6.3, where the pg_user_mappings view disclosed user mapping options to any user having USAGE privilege on the associated foreign server, including the password. An attacker could then use the password to run arbitrary queries against the server or others accepting the same credentials, not just the limited queries one can issue via foreign tables.",
