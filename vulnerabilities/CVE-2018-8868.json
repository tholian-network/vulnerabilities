	"id": "CVE-2018-8868",
	"description": "Medtronic MyCareLink Patient Monitor, 24950 MyCareLink Monitor, all versions, and 24952 MyCareLink Monitor, all versions, contains debug code meant to test the functionality of the monitor's communication interfaces, including the interface between the monitor and implantable cardiac device. An attacker with physical access to the device can apply the other vulnerabilities within this advisory to access this debug functionality. This debug functionality provides the ability to read and write arbitrary memory values to implantable cardiac devices via inductive or short range wireless protocols. An attacker with close physical proximity to a target implantable cardiac device can use this debug functionality.",
