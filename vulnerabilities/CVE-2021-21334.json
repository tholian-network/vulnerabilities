	"id": "CVE-2021-21334",
	"description": "A security issue was found in containerd before version 1.3.10 and 1.4.x before 1.4.4. Containers launched through containerd's CRI implementation (through Kubernetes, crictl, or any other pod/container client that uses the containerd CRI service) that share the same image may receive incorrect environment variables, including values that are defined for other containers. If the affected containers have different security contexts, this may allow sensitive information to be unintentionally shared.",
