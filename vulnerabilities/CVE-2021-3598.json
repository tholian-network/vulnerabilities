	"description": "There's a flaw in OpenEXR's ImfDeepScanLineInputFile functionality in versions prior to 3.0.5. An attacker who is able to submit a crafted file to an application linked with OpenEXR could cause an out-of-bounds read. The greatest risk from this flaw is to application availability.\n\nA heap-buffer overflow was found in the readChars function of OpenEXR before version 3.0.5. An attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running the application compiled against OpenEXR.",
