	"description": "An out of bounds read flaw was discovered in libssh2 before 1.8.1 in the way SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST packets with an exit status message and no payload are parsed. A remote attacker who compromises a SSH server may be able to cause a Denial of Service or read data in the client memory.\n\nAn issue has been found in libssh2 before 1.8.1 where a server could send a specially crafted SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST packet with an exit status message and no payload. This would result in an out of bounds memory comparison.",
