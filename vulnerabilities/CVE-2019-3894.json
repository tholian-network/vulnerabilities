	"id": "CVE-2019-3894",
	"description": "It was discovered that the ElytronManagedThread in Wildfly's Elytron subsystem in versions from 11 to 16 stores a SecurityIdentity to run the thread as. These threads do not necessarily terminate if the keep alive time has not expired. This could allow a shared thread to use the wrong security identity when executing.",
