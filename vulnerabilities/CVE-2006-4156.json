	"description": "PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in big.php in pearlabs mafia moblog 6 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the pathtotemplate parameter.

CVE has not verified either claim, but during August 2006, the original researcher made several significant errors regarding this bug type",
