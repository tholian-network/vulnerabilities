	"id": "CVE-2021-44151",
	"description": "An issue was discovered in Reprise RLM 14.2. As the session cookies are small, an attacker can hijack any existing sessions by bruteforcing the 4 hex-character session cookie on the Windows version (the Linux version appears to have 8 characters). An attacker can obtain the static part of the cookie (cookie name) by first making a request to any page on the application (e.g., /goforms/menu) and saving the name of the cookie sent with the response. The attacker can then use the name of the cookie and try to request that same page, setting a random value for the cookie. If any user has an active session, the page should return with the authorized content, when a valid cookie value is hit.",
