	"id": "CVE-2022-32154",
	"description": "Dashboards in Splunk Enterprise versions before 9.0 might let an attacker inject risky search commands into a form token when the token is used in a query in a cross-origin request. The result bypasses SPL safeguards for risky commands. See New capabilities can limit access to some custom and potentially risky commands (https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.0.0/Security/SPLsafeguards#New_capabilities_can_limit_access_to_some_custom_and_potentially_risky_commands) for more information. Note that the attack is browser-based and an attacker cannot exploit it at will.\n\nAffected: Splunk, Inc Splunk Enterprise < 9.0\nAffected: Splunk, Inc Splunk Cloud Platform < 8.2.2106\n\nAffected: Splunk, Inc Splunk Enterprise 9.0\nAffected: Splunk, Inc Splunk Cloud Platform 8.2.2106\n\nAffected: Splunk, Inc Splunk Enterprise 9.0\nAffected: Splunk, Inc Splunk Cloud Platform 8.2.2106",
