	"description": "procps-ng before version 3.3.15 is vulnerable to a stack buffer overflow in pgrep. This vulnerability is mitigated by FORTIFY, as it involves strncat() to a stack-allocated string. When pgrep is compiled with FORTIFY (as on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora), the impact is limited to a crash.\n\nA potential stack-based buffer overflow has been found in the pgrep utility of procps-ng <= 3.3.14. If the strlen() of one of the cmdline arguments is greater than INT_MAX (it is possible), then the \"int bytes\" could wrap around completely, back to a very large positive int, and the next strncat() would be called with a huge number of destination bytes (a stack-based buffer overflow).\r\nFortunately, every distribution that we checked compiles its procps utilities with FORTIFY, and the fortified strncat() detects and aborts the buffer overflow before it occurs.",
