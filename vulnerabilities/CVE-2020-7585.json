	"description": "A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC PCS 7 V8.2 and earlier (All versions), SIMATIC PCS 7 V9.0 (All versions < V9.0 SP3), SIMATIC PDM (All versions < V9.2), SIMATIC STEP 7 V5.X (All versions < V5.6 SP2 HF3), SINAMICS STARTER (containing STEP 7 OEM version) (All versions < V5.4 HF2). A DLL Hijacking vulnerability could allow a local attacker to execute code with elevated privileges. The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with local access to the affected systems. Successful exploitation requires user privileges but no user interaction. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to compromise the availability of the system as well as to have access to confidential information.\n\nAffected: Siemens SIMATIC PCS 7 V8.2 and earlier All versions\nAffected: Siemens SIMATIC PCS 7 V9.0 All versions < V9.0 SP3\nAffected: Siemens SIMATIC PDM All versions < V9.2\nAffected: Siemens SIMATIC STEP 7 V5.X All versions < V5.6 SP2 HF3\nAffected: Siemens SINAMICS STARTER (containing STEP 7 OEM version) All versions < V5.4 HF2\n\nAffected: Siemens SIMATIC PCS 7 V8.2 and earlier *\nAffected: Siemens SIMATIC PCS 7 V9.0 All versions < V9.0 SP3\nAffected: Siemens SIMATIC PDM < V9.2\nAffected: Siemens SIMATIC STEP 7 V5.X All versions < V5.6 SP2 HF3\nAffected: Siemens SINAMICS STARTER (containing STEP 7 OEM version) All versions < V5.4 HF2\n\nAffected: Siemens SIMATIC PCS 7 V8.2 and earlier *\nAffected: Siemens SIMATIC PCS 7 V9.0 All versions < V9.0 SP3\nAffected: Siemens SIMATIC PDM < V9.2\nAffected: Siemens SIMATIC STEP 7 V5.X All versions < V5.6 SP2 HF3\nAffected: Siemens SINAMICS STARTER (containing STEP 7 OEM version) All versions < V5.4 HF2",
