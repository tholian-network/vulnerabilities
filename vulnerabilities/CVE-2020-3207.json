	"description": "A vulnerability in the processing of boot options of specific Cisco IOS XE Software switches could allow an authenticated, local attacker with root shell access to the underlying operating system (OS) to conduct a command injection attack during device boot. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation checks while processing boot options. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying device boot options to execute attacker-provided code. A successful exploit may allow an attacker to bypass the Secure Boot process and execute malicious code on an affected device with root-level privileges.",
