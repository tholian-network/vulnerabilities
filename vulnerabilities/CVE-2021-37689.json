{
	"id": "CVE-2021-37689",
	"description": "In TensorFlow before version 2.6.0 an attacker can craft a TFLite model that would trigger a null pointer dereference, which would result in a crash and denial of service. This is caused by the MLIR optimization of L2NormalizeReduceAxis operator. The implementation unconditionally dereferences a pointer to an iterator to a vector without checking that the vector has elements.",
