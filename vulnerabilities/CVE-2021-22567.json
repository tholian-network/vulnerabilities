	"description": "Bidirectional Unicode text can be interpreted and compiled differently than how it appears in editors which can be exploited to get nefarious code passed a code review by appearing benign. An attacker could embed a source that is invisible to a code reviewer that modifies the behavior of a program in unexpected ways.\n\nAffected: Google LLC Dart SDK < 2.15.0-268.18.beta\n\nA security issue has been found in the Dart Core SDK before version 2.15.0. Bidirectional Unicode text can be interpreted and compiled differently than how it appears in editors and code-review tools. Exploiting this an attacker could embed source that is invisible to a code reviewer but that modifies the behavior of a program in unexpected ways. This vulnerability impacts all projects that allow Dart source contributions.\n\nAffected: Google LLC Dart SDK 2.15.0-268.18.beta\n\nAffected: Google LLC Dart SDK 2.15.0-268.18.beta",
