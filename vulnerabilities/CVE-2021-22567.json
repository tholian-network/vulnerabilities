	"id": "CVE-2021-22567",
	"description": "A security issue has been found in the Dart Core SDK before version 2.15.0. Bidirectional Unicode text can be interpreted and compiled differently than how it appears in editors and code-review tools. Exploiting this an attacker could embed source that is invisible to a code reviewer but that modifies the behavior of a program in unexpected ways. This vulnerability impacts all projects that allow Dart source contributions.",
