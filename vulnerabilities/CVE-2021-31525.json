{
	"id": "CVE-2021-31525",
	"description": "net/http in Go before 1.15.12 and 1.16.x before 1.16.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) via a large header to ReadRequest or ReadResponse. Server, Transport, and Client can each be affected in some configurations.\n\nA security issue has been found in Go before version 1.16.4. ReadRequest and ReadResponse in net/http can hit an unrecoverable panic when reading a very large header (over 7MB on 64-bit architectures, or over 4MB on 32-bit ones). Transport and Client are vulnerable and the program can be made to crash by a malicious server.  Server is not vulnerable by default, but can be if the default max header of 1MB is overridden by setting Server.MaxHeaderBytes to a higher value, in which case the program can be made to crash by a malicious client.",
