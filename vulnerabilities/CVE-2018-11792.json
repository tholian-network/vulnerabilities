This may pose a potential security risk, such as having ALTER on a table and ALL on a particular database allows a user to move the table to a database with ALL, which will automatically grant that user with ALL privilege on that table due to the privilege inherited from the database.\n\nAffected: Apache Software Foundation Apache Impala Apache Impala 3.0.0\n\nAffected: Apache Software Foundation Apache Impala Apache Impala 3.0.0",
