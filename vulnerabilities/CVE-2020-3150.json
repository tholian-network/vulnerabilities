	"id": "CVE-2020-3150",
	"description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV110W and RV215W Series Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to download sensitive information from the device, which could include the device configuration. The vulnerability is due to improper authorization of an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing a specific URI on the web-based management interface of the router, but only after any valid user has opened a specific file on the device since the last reboot. A successful exploit would allow the attacker to view sensitive information, which should be restricted.",
