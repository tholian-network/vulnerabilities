{
	"id": "CVE-2019-17192",
	"description": "The WebRTC component in the Signal Private Messenger application through 4.47.7 for Android processes videoconferencing RTP packets before a callee chooses to answer a call, which might make it easier for remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via malformed packets. NOTE: the vendor plans to continue this behavior for performance reasons unless a WebRTC design change occurs",
