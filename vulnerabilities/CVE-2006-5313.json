	"description": "Hastymail 1.5 and earlier before 20061008 allows remote authenticated users to send arbitrary SMTP commands by placing them after a CRLF.CRLF sequence in the smtp_message parameter.  NOTE: this crosses privilege boundaries if the SMTP server configuration prevents a user from establishing a direct SMTP session.  NOTE: this is a different type of issue than CVE-2006-5262.",
