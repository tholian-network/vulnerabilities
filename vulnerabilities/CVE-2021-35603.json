	"id": "CVE-2021-35603",
	"description": "Vulnerability in the Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component: JSSE). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u311, 8u301, 11.0.12, 17; Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition: 20.3.3 and 21.2.0. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via TLS to compromise Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a web service which supplies data to the APIs. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 3.7 (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).\n\nA security issue has been found in OpenJDK before versions 7u321, 8u312, 11.0.13 and 17.0.1 in the security-libs/javax.net.ssl component. A difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via TLS to compromise OpenJDK. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset of OpenJDK accessible data.\r\n\r\nNote : This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security.
