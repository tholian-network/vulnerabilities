	"description": "The Canon MG3100, MG5300, MG6100, MP495, MX340, MX870, MX890, MX920, and MX922 printers allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (device hang) via a crafted LAN_TXT24 parameter to English/pages_MacUS/cgi_lan.cgi followed by a direct request to English/pages_MacUS/lan_set_content.html.  NOTE: the vendor has apparently responded by stating \"Canon believes that its printers will not have to deal with unauthorized access to the network from an external location as long as the printers are used in a secured environment.\"",
