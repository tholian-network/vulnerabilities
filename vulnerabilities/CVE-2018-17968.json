{
	"id": "CVE-2018-17968",
	"description": "A gambling smart contract implementation for RuletkaIo, an Ethereum gambling game, generates a random value that is predictable by an external contract call. The developer wrote a random() function that uses a block timestamp and block hash from the Ethereum blockchain. This can be predicted by writing the same random function code in an exploit contract to determine the deadSeat value.",
