	"id": "CVE-2021-20195",
	"description": "A flaw was found in keycloak in versions before 13.0.0. A Self Stored XSS attack vector escalating to a complete account takeover is possible due to user-supplied data fields not being properly encoded and Javascript code being used to process the data. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\nA security issue was found in keycloak before version 12.0.3. A self stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack vector escalating to a complete account takeover is possible due to user-supplied data fields not being properly encoded and Javascript code being used to process the data. Specifically, the Account page does not HTML-encode the user first name, and last name, which means a malicious HTML code, which executes malicious Javascript code, can be embedded into the Account page. Even though the malicious Javascript code is linked to the attacker user (Self-XSS), it can be exploited on the Keycloak admin browser, using the Impersonation functionality, and thus the attacker is able to compromise Keycloak.",
