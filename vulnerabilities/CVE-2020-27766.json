	"id": "CVE-2020-27766",
	"description": "A flaw was found in ImageMagick in MagickCore/statistic.c. An attacker who submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior in the form of values outside the range of type `unsigned long`. This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability, but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined behavior. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.8-69.",
