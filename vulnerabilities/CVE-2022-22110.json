A user with privileges to update his password could change it to a weak password, such as those with a length of a single character. This may allow an attacker to brute-force usersâ€™ passwords with minimal to no computational effort.\n\nAffected: Bottelet DaybydayCRM <= 2.2.0, 1.1\nAffected: Bottelet flarepoint <= 2.2.0, 1.1",
