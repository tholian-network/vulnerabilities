{
	"id": "CVE-2017-7180",
	"description": "Net Monitor for Employees Pro through 5.3.4 has an unquoted service path, which allows a Security Feature Bypass of its documented \"Block applications\" design goal. The local attacker must have privileges to write to program.exe in a protected directory, such as the %SYSTEMDRIVE% directory, and thus the issue is not interpreted as a direct privilege escalation. However, the local attacker might have the goal of executing program.exe even though program.exe is a blocked application.",
