	"description": "An issue was discovered in Tor before 0.4.6.5, aka TROVE-2021-003. An attacker can forge RELAY_END or RELAY_RESOLVED to bypass the intended access control for ending a stream.\n\nA security issue has been found in Tor before version 0.4.5.9. Relays could spoof RELAY_END or RELAY_RESOLVED cell on half-closed streams because clients failed to validate which hop sent these cells. This would allow a relay on a circuit to end a stream that wasn't actually built with it.",
