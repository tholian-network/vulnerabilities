	"id": "CVE-2018-9068",
	"description": "The IMM2 First Failure Data Capture function collects management module logs and diagnostic information when a hardware error is detected. This information is made available for download through an SFTP server hosted on the IMM2 management network interface. In versions earlier than 4.90 for Lenovo System x and earlier than 6.80 for IBM System x, the credentials to access the SFTP server are hard-coded and described in the IMM2 documentation, allowing an attacker with management network access to obtain the collected FFDC data. After applying the update, the IMM2 will create random SFTP credentials for use with OneCLI.\n\nAffected: Lenovo Group Ltd. System x IMM2 firmware versions earlier than 4.90\nAffected: IBM Corporation System x IMM2 firmware versions earlier than 6.80",
