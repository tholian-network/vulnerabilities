	"description": "In Wireshark 2.6.0 to 2.6.5, the 6LoWPAN dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-6lowpan.c by avoiding use of a TVB before its creation.\n\nAn assertion failure has been found in the 6LoWPAN dissector of Wireshark versions prior to 2.6.6, which could be triggered by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.",
