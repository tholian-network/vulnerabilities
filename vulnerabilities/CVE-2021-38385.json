	"description": "Tor before 0.3.5.16, 0.4.5.10, and 0.4.6.7 mishandles the relationship between batch-signature verification and single-signature verification, leading to a remote assertion failure, aka TROVE-2021-007.\n\nA remote denial of service issue has been fixed in tor >= 0.4.6.7. An assertion failure could be caused by a behavior mismatch between the batch-signature verification code and the single-signature verification code. This assertion failure could be triggered remotely, leading to a denial of service attack.",
