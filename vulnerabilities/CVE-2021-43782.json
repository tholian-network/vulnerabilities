	"description": "Tuleap is a Libre and Open Source tool for end to end traceability of application and system developments. This is a follow up to GHSA-887w-pv2r-x8pm/CVE-2021-41276, the initial fix was incomplete. Tuleap does not sanitize properly the search filter built from the ldap_id attribute of a user during the daily synchronization. A malicious user could force accounts to be suspended or take over another account by forcing the update of the ldap_uid attribute. Note that the malicious user either need to have site administrator capability on the Tuleap instance or be an LDAP operator with the capability to create/modify account. The Tuleap instance needs to have the LDAP plugin activated and enabled for this issue to be exploitable. The following versions contain the fix: Tuleap Community Edition 13.2.99.83, Tuleap Enterprise Edition 13.1-6, and Tuleap Enterprise Edition 13.2-4.\n\nAffected: Enalean tuleap < 13.2.99.83, >= 13.1-1,  < 13.1-6, >= 13.2-1, < 13.2-4\n\nAffected: Enalean tuleap < 13.2.99.83, >= 13.1-1, < 13.1-6, >= 13.2-1, < 13.2-4\n\nAffected: Enalean tuleap < 13.2.99.83, >= 13.1-1, < 13.1-6, >= 13.2-1, < 13.2-4",
