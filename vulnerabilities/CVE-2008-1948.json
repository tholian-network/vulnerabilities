{
	"id": "CVE-2008-1948",
	"description": "The _gnutls_server_name_recv_params function in lib/ext_server_name.c in libgnutls in gnutls-serv in GnuTLS before 2.2.4 does not properly calculate the number of Server Names in a TLS 1.0 Client Hello message during extension handling, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a zero value for the length of Server Names, which leads to a buffer overflow in session resumption data in the pack_security_parameters function, aka GNUTLS-SA-2008-1-1.",
