	"description": "A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web UI on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the targeted user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could alter the configuration, execute commands, or reload an affected device.",
