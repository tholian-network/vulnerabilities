{
	"id": "CVE-2016-10009",
	"description": "Untrusted search path vulnerability in ssh-agent.c in ssh-agent in OpenSSH before 7.4 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary local PKCS#11 modules by leveraging control over a forwarded agent-socket.\n\nIt was found that ssh-agent could load PKCS#11 modules from paths outside of a trusted whitelist. An attacker able to load a crafted PKCS#11 module across a forwarded agent channel could potentially use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the system running the ssh-agent. Note that the attacker must have control of the forwarded agent-socket and the ability to write to the filesystem of the host running ssh-agent.",
