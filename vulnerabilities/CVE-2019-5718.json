	"id": "CVE-2019-5718",
	"description": "In Wireshark 2.6.0 to 2.6.5 and 2.4.0 to 2.4.11, the RTSE dissector and other ASN.1 dissectors could crash. This was addressed in epan/charsets.c by adding a get_t61_string length check.\n\nAn out-of-bounds read has been found in the RTSE dissector of Wireshark versions prior to 2.6.6, which could be triggered by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.",
