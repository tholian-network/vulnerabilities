	"id": "CVE-2021-23239",
	"description": "The sudoedit personality of Sudo before 1.9.5 may allow a local unprivileged user to perform arbitrary directory-existence tests by winning a sudo_edit.c race condition in replacing a user-controlled directory by a symlink to an arbitrary path.\n\nA security issue was found in sudo before version 1.9.5. A race condition in sudoedit could have allowed an attacker to test for the existence of directories in arbitrary locations in the file system.",
