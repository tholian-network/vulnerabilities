A user with access to search the directory can crash slapd by issuing a search including the Paged Results control with a page size of 0.\n\nA double-free flaw was found in the way OpenLDAP's slapd server <= 2.4.44 using the MDB backend handled LDAP searches. A remote attacker with access to search the directory could potentially use this flaw to crash slapd by issuing a specially crafted LDAP search query by including the Paged Results control with a page size of 0.",
