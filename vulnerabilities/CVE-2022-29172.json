	"id": "CVE-2022-29172",
	"description": "Auth0 is an authentication broker that supports both social and enterprise identity providers, including Active Directory, LDAP, Google Apps, and Salesforce. In versions before `11.33.0`, when the “additional signup fields” feature [is configured](https://github.com/auth0/lock#additional-sign-up-fields), a malicious actor can inject invalidated HTML code into these additional fields, which is then stored in the service `user_metdata` payload (using the `name` property). Verification emails, when applicable, are generated using this metadata. It is therefor possible for an actor to craft a malicious link by injecting HTML, which is then rendered as the recipient's name within the delivered email template. You are impacted by this vulnerability if you are using `auth0-lock` version `11.32.2` or lower and are using the “additional signup fields” feature in your application. Upgrade to version `11.33.0`.\n\nAffected: auth0 lock < 11.33.0",
