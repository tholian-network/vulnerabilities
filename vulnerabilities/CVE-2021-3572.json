	"id": "CVE-2021-3572",
	"description": "A flaw was found in python-pip in the way it handled Unicode separators in git references. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to install a different revision on a repository. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity. This is fixed in python-pip version 21.1.\n\nA security issue has been found in pip before version 21.1. Maliciously formatted tags could be used to hijack a commit-based pin. Using the fact that all of unicode's whitespace characters were allowed as separators - which git allows as a part of a tag name - it is possible to force a different revision to be installed if an attacker gains access to the repository.",
