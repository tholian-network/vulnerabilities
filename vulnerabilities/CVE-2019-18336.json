	"id": "CVE-2019-18336",
	"description": "A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC S7-300 CPU family (incl. related ET200 CPUs and SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V3.X.17), SIMATIC TDC CP51M1 (All versions < V1.1.8), SIMATIC TDC CPU555 (All versions < V1.1.1), SINUMERIK 840D sl (All versions < V4.8.6), SINUMERIK 840D sl (All versions < V4.94). Specially crafted packets sent to port 102/tcp (Profinet) could cause the affected device to go into defect mode. A restart is required in order to recover the system. Successful exploitation requires an attacker to have network access to port 102/tcp, with no authentication. No user interation is required. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.\n\nAffected: Siemens AG SIMATIC S7-300 CPU family (incl. related ET200 CPUs and SIPLUS variants) All versions < V3.X.17\nAffected: Siemens AG SIMATIC TDC CP51M1 All versions < V1.1.8\nAffected: Siemens AG SIMATIC TDC CPU555 All versions < V1.1.1\nAffected: Siemens AG SINUMERIK 840D sl All versions < V4.8.6\nAffected: Siemens AG SINUMERIK 840D sl All versions < V4.94",
