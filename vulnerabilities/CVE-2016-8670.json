	"id": "CVE-2016-8670",
	"description": "Integer signedness error in the dynamicGetbuf function in gd_io_dp.c in the GD Graphics Library (aka libgd) through 2.2.3, as used in PHP before 5.6.28 and 7.x before 7.0.13, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted imagecreatefromstring call.\n\nA vulnerability was found in gd. Integer underflow in a calculation in dynamicGetbuf() was incorrectly handled, leading in some circumstances to an out of bounds write through a very large argument to memcpy(). An attacker could create a crafted image that would lead to a crash or, potentially, code execution.",
