	"description": "curl version curl 7.54.1 to and including curl 7.59.0 contains a CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in denial of service and more that can result in curl might overflow a heap based memory buffer when closing down an FTP connection with very long server command replies.. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in curl < 7.54.1 and curl >= 7.60.0.\n\ncurl >= 7.54.1 and < 7.60.0 might overflow a heap based memory buffer when closing down an FTP connection with very long server command replies.\r\nWhen doing FTP transfers, curl keeps a spare \"closure handle\" around internally that will be used when an FTP connection gets shut down since the original curl easy handle is then already removed. FTP server response data that gets cached from the original transfer might then be larger than the default buffer size (16 KB) allocated in the \"closure handle\", which can lead to a buffer overwrite. The contents and size of that overwrite is controllable by the server.",
