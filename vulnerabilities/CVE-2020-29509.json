{
	"id": "CVE-2020-29509",
	"description": "The encoding/xml package in Go (all versions) does not correctly preserve the semantics of attribute namespace prefixes during tokenization round-trips, which allows an attacker to craft inputs that behave in conflicting ways during different stages of processing in affected downstream applications.\n\nGo's encoding/xml handles namespace prefixes on XML attributes in a way that causes crafted markup to mutate during round-trips through the xml.Decoder and xml.Encoder implementations. Encoding and decoding using Go's encoding/xml can change the observed namespace as well as the observed local name of a maliciously crafted XML attribute.\r\n\r\nAffected applications include software that relies on XML integrity for security-sensitive decisions. Prominent examples of such applications include SAML and XML-DSig implementations.",
