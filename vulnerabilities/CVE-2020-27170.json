	"id": "CVE-2020-27170",
	"description": "A gap in the Linux kernel mechanism to mitigate speculatively out-of-bounds loads (Spectre mitigation) has been identified. Unprivileged BPF programs running on affected systems can bypass the protection and execute speculatively out-of-bounds loads from any location within the kernel memory. This can be abused to extract contents of kernel memory via side-channel. The identified gap is that unprivileged BPF programs are allowed to perform pointer arithmetic on particular pointer types not defining ptr_limit. Pointer arithmetic on such pointer types is not protected against out-of-bounds speculation. The issue is fixed in kernel versions 5.11.8 and 5.10.25.",
