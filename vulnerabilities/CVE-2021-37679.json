	"id": "CVE-2021-37679",
	"description": "In TensorFlow before version 2.6.0 it is possible to nest a tf.map_fn within another tf.map_fn call. However, if the input tensor is a RaggedTensor and there is no function signature provided, code assumes the output is a fully specified tensor and fills output buffer with uninitialized contents from the heap. The t and z outputs should be identical, however this is not the case. The last row of t contains data from the heap which can be used to leak other memory information. The bug lies in the conversion from a Variant tensor to a RaggedTensor. The implementation does not check that all inner shapes match and this results in the additional dimensions. The same implementation can result in data loss, if input tensor is tweaked.",
