{
	"id": "CVE-2018-5407",
	"description": "Simultaneous Multi-threading (SMT) in processors can enable local users to exploit software vulnerable to timing attacks via a side-channel timing attack on 'port contention'.\n\nA vulnerability has been found in the ECC scalar multiplication implementation of OpenSSL < 1.1.0i and <= 1.0.2p. The implementation, used in e.g. ECDSA and ECDH, has been shown\r\nto be vulnerable to a microarchitecture timing side channel attack. An attacker with sufficient access to mount local timing attacks during ECDSA signature generation could recover the private key.",
