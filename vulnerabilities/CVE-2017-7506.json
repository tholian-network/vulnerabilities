	"description": "spice versions though 0.13 are vulnerable to out-of-bounds memory access when processing specially crafted messages from authenticated attacker to the spice server resulting into crash and/or server memory leak.\n\nTwo security issues have been found in spice <= 0.12.8, allowing a remote, authenticated user to get access to memory content by sending a number of monitors bigger than the number of items, and to trigger an integer overflow of the buffer_size variable, leading to a potentially exploitable buffer overflow.",
