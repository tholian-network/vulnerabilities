{
	"id": "CVE-2021-23842",
	"description": "Communication to the AMC2 uses a state-of-the-art cryptographic algorithm for symmetric encryption called Blowfish. An attacker could retrieve the key from the firmware to decrypt network traffic between the AMC2 and the host system. Thus, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to decrypt and modify network traffic, decrypt and further investigate the device\\'s firmware file, and change the device configuration. The attacker needs to have access to the local network, typically even the same subnet.\n\nAffected: Bosch AMS < 4.0\nAffected: Bosch APE <= 3.8.x\nAffected: Bosch BIS < 4.9.1\nAffected: Bosch AMC2 all",
