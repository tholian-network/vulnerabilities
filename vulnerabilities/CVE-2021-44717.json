{
	"id": "CVE-2021-44717",
	"description": "Go before 1.16.12 and 1.17.x before 1.17.5 on UNIX allows write operations to an unintended file or unintended network connection as a consequence of erroneous closing of file descriptor 0 after file-descriptor exhaustion.\n\nA security issue has been found in go before version 1.17.5. When a Go program running on a Unix system is out of file descriptors and calls syscall.ForkExec (including indirectly by using the os/exec package), syscall.ForkExec can close file descriptor 0 as it fails. If this happens (or can be provoked) repeatedly, it can result in misdirected I/O such as writing network traffic intended for one connection to a different connection, or content intended for one file to a different one.",
