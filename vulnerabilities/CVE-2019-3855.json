	"id": "CVE-2019-3855",
	"description": "An integer overflow flaw which could lead to an out of bounds write was discovered in libssh2 before 1.8.1 in the way packets are read from the server. A remote attacker who compromises a SSH server may be able to execute code on the client system when a user connects to the server.\n\nA out-of-bounds write has been found in libssh2 before 1.8.1, where a malicious server could send a specially crafted packet which could result in an unchecked integer overflow. The value would then be used to allocate memory causing a possible memory write out of bounds error.",
