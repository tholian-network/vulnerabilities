{
	"id": "CVE-2021-41190",
	"description": "In the OCI Distribution Specification version 1.0.0 and prior, the Content-Type header alone was used to determine the type of document during push and pull operations. Documents that contain both “manifests” and “layers” fields could be interpreted as either a manifest or an index in the absence of an accompanying Content-Type header. If a Content-Type header changed between two pulls of the same digest, a client may interpret the resulting content differently.\r\n\r\nThe OCI Distribution Specification will be updated to require that a mediaType value present in a manifest or index match the Content-Type header used during the push and pull operations.",
