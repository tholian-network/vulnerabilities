	"description": "In Pivotal tc Server, 3.x versions prior to 3.2.19 and 4.x versions prior to 4.0.10, and Pivotal tc Runtimes, 7.x versions prior to 7.0.99.B, 8.x versions prior to 8.5.47.A, and 9.x versions prior to 9.0.27.A, when a tc Runtime instance is configured with the JMX Socket Listener, a local attacker without access to the tc Runtime process or configuration files is able to manipulate the RMI registry to perform a man-in-the-middle attack to capture user names and passwords used to access the JMX interface. The attacker can then use these credentials to access the JMX interface and gain complete control over the tc Runtime instance.\n\nAffected: Pivotal Pivotal tc Server 4.x < 4.0.10\nAffected: Pivotal Pivotal tc Server 3.x < 3.2.19\nAffected: Pivotal Pivotal tc Server 4.x Runtimes < 7.0.99.B, < 8.5.47.A, < 9.0.27.A\nAffected: Pivotal Pivotal tc Server 3.x Runtimes < 7.0.99.B, < 8.5.47.A",
