	"id": "CVE-2008-6994",
	"description": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the SaveAs feature (SaveFileAsWithFilter function) in win_util.cc in Google Chrome 0.2.149.27 allows user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a web page with a long TITLE element, which triggers the overflow when the user saves the page and a long filename is generated.  NOTE: it might be possible to exploit this issue via an HTTP response that includes a long filename in a Content-Disposition header.",
