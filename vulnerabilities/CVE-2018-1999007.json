	"id": "CVE-2018-1999007",
	"description": "A cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in Jenkins 2.132 and earlier, 2.121.1 and earlier in the Stapler web framework's org/kohsuke/stapler/Stapler.java that allows attackers with the ability to control the existence of some URLs in Jenkins to define JavaScript that would be executed in another user's browser when that other user views HTTP 404 error pages while Stapler debug mode is enabled.\n\nStapler is the web framework used by Jenkins to route HTTP requests. When its debug mode is enabled, HTTP 404 error pages display diagnostic information. Those error pages did not escape parts of URLs they displayed before Jenkins 2.133, in rare cases resulting in a cross-site scripting vulnerability.",
