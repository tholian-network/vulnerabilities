	"description": "chkstat in SuSE Linux 9.0 through 10.0 allows local users to modify permissions of files by creating a hardlink to a file from a world-writable directory, which can cause the link count to drop to 1 when the file is deleted or replaced, which is then modified by chkstat to use weaker permissions.",
