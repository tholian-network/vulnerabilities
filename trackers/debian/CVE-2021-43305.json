{
	"name": "CVE-2021-43305",
	"description": "Heap buffer overflow in Clickhouse's LZ4 compression codec when parsing a malicious query. There is no verification that the copy operations in the LZ4::decompressImpl loop and especially the arbitrary copy operation wildCopy<copy_amount>(op, ip, copy_end), don’t exceed the destination buffer’s limits. This issue is very similar to CVE-2021-43304, but the vulnerable copy operation is in a different wildCopy call.",
