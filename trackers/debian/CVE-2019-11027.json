	"description": "Ruby OpenID (aka ruby-openid) through 2.8.0 has a remotely exploitable flaw. This library is used by Rails web applications to integrate with OpenID Providers.

Developers who based their OpenID integration heavily on the \"example app\" provided by the project are at highest risk.",
