	"name": "CVE-2008-1142",
	"description": "rxvt 2.6.4 opens a terminal window on :0 if the DISPLAY environment variable is not set, which might allow local users to hijack X11 connections.  NOTE: it was later reported that rxvt-unicode, mrxvt, aterm, multi-aterm, and wterm are also affected.  NOTE: realistic attack scenarios require that the victim enters a command on the wrong machine.",
