	"description": "The png_load function in lib/png.c in SWFTools 0.9.2 does not properly validate a multiplication of width and bits-per-pixel values, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read and application crash) via a crafted file, as demonstrated by an erroneous png_load call that occurs because of incorrect integer data types in png2swf.",
