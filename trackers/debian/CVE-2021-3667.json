{
	"name": "CVE-2021-3667",
	"description": "An improper locking issue was found in the virStoragePoolLookupByTargetPath API of libvirt. It occurs in the storagePoolLookupByTargetPath function where a locked virStoragePoolObj object is not properly released on ACL permission failure. Clients connecting to the read-write socket with limited ACL permissions could use this flaw to acquire the lock and prevent other users from accessing storage pool/volume APIs, resulting in a denial of service condition. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.",
