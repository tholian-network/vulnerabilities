{
	"name": "CVE-2016-10396",
	"description": "The racoon daemon in IPsec-Tools 0.8.2 contains a remotely exploitable computational-complexity attack when parsing and storing ISAKMP fragments. The implementation permits a remote attacker to exhaust computational resources on the remote endpoint by repeatedly sending ISAKMP fragment packets in a particular order such that the worst-case computational complexity is realized in the algorithm utilized to determine if reassembly of the fragments can take place.",
