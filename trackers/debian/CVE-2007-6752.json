	"description": "** DISPUTED ** Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Drupal 7.12 and earlier allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of arbitrary users for requests that end a session via the user/logout URI.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this issue, by considering the \"security benefit against platform complexity and performance impact\" and concluding that a change to the logout behavior is not planned because \"for most sites it is not worth the trade-off.\"",
