	"name": "CVE-2021-28876",
	"type": "incorrect calculation",
	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "In the standard library in Rust before 1.52.0, the Zip implementation has a panic safety issue. It calls __iterator_get_unchecked() more than once for the same index when the underlying iterator panics (in certain conditions). This bug could lead to a memory safety violation due to an unmet safety requirement for the TrustedRandomAccess trait.",
