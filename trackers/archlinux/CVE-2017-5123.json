	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "It was discovered that when the waitid() syscall in Linux kernel v4.13 was refactored, it accidentally stopped checking that the incoming argument was pointing to userspace. This allowed local attackers to write directly to kernel memory, which could lead to privilege escalation.",
