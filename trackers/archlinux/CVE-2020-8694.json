	"name": "CVE-2020-8694",
	"type": "information disclosure",
	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "An information disclosure flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Intel Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) implementation. A local non-privileged attacker could infer secrets by measuring power usage and also infer private data by observing the power usage of calculations performed on the data.",

	"notes": "A temporary measure would be to remove the ability for non-root users to read the current RAPL energy reporting metrics.\r\nThis can be done with the command:\r\n\r\n# sudo chmod 400 /sys/class/powercap/intel_rapl/*/energy_uj\r\n\r\nThis mitigation will only work on the current boot and will need to be reapplied at each system boot to remain in effect."
