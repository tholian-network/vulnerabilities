	"type": "content spoofing",
	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "The combined, single character, version of the letter 'i' with any of the potential accents in unicode, such as acute or grave, can be spoofed in the addressbar of Firefox before 57.0 by the dotless version of 'i' followed by the same accent as a second character with most font sets. This allows for domain spoofing attacks because these combined domain names do not display as punycode.",
