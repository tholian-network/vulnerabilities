	"type": "denial of service",
	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "The Git protocol does not specify what should happen in the case of an empty packet line (that is a packet line \"0004\"). currently it indicates success, but does not return a packet in the case where an empty line is hit. The smart protocol was not prepared to handle such packets in all cases, though, resulting in a `NULL` pointer dereference. The issue is fixed by returning an error instead.",
