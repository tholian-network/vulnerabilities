	"type": "private key recovery",
	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "A security issue was found in libtpms before version 0.8.0. The TPM 2 implementation returns 2048 bit keys with ~1984 bit strength due to a bug in the TCG specification. The bug is in the key creation algorithm in RsaAdjustPrimeCandidate(), which is called before the prime number check.\r\n\r\nUpgrading to a fixed release (0.8.0+) is not sufficient. The only way to fix it is to unseal all data, delete the old TPM state file, generate a new one, then reseal the data.",
