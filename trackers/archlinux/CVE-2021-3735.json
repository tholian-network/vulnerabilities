	"type": "denial of service",
	"severity": "Low",
	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "A deadlock issue was found in the AHCI controller device (ich9-ahci) of QEMU while handling a host-to-device Register FIS (Frame Information Structure) packet from the guest. The bug is triggered on a software reset (ahci_reset_port) in the handle_reg_h2d_fis() function [1]. A privileged user inside the guest could use this flaw to hang the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition.",
