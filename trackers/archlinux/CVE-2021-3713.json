	"type": "arbitrary code execution",
	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "An out-of-bounds write issue was found in the UAS (USB Attached SCSI) device emulation of QEMU. It occurs due to missing sanity checks in the usb_uas_handle_data() function in hw/usb/dev-uas.c. In particular, the device uses the guest-supplied stream number unchecked, which can lead to guest-triggered out-of-bounds access to the UASDevice->data3 and UASDevice->status3 fields.",
