	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "Nextcloud Server supports application specific tokens for authentication purposes. These tokens are supposed to be granted to a specific applications (e.g. DAV sync clients), and can also be configured by the user to not have any filesystem access. Due to a lacking permission check, the tokens were able to change their own permissions in versions prior to 21.0.3. Thus fileystem limited tokens were able to grant themselves access to the filesystem.",
