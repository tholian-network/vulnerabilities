	"type": "arbitrary code execution",
	"severity": "Critical",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "While updating the internal nick list, Irssi may incorrectly use the GHashTable interface and free the nick while updating it. This will then result in use-after-free conditions on each access of the hash table. Note that this should not happen with a conforming IRC server, so it requires control over the IRC server or a position of man-in-the-middle to be exploitable.",
