	"description": "A security issue has been found in TensorFlow before version 2.4.2. An attacker can cause a heap buffer overflow in `QuantizedReshape` by passing in invalid thresholds for the quantization. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a324ac84e573fba362a5e53d4e74d5de6729933e/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantized_reshape_op.cc#L38-L55) assumes that the 2 arguments are always valid scalars and tries to access the numeric value directly. However, if any of these tensors is empty, then `.flat<T>()` is an empty buffer and accessing the element at position 0 results in overflow.",
