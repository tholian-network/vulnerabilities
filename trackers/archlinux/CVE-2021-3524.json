	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "A security issue was found in the Red Hat Ceph Storage RadosGW (Ceph Object Gateway) before version 15.2.12. The vulnerability is related to the injection of HTTP headers via a CORS ExposeHeader tag. The newline character in the ExposeHeader tag in the CORS configuration file generates a header injection in the response when the CORS request is made.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the prior bug fix for CVE-2020-10753 did not account for the use of \\r as a header separator, thus a new flaw has been created.",
