	"name": "CVE-2020-27749",
	"type": "arbitrary code execution",
	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "grub_parser_split_cmdline() expands variable names present in the supplied command line in to their corresponding variable contents and uses a 1kB stack buffer for temporary storage without sufficient bounds checking. If the function is called with a command line that references a variable with a sufficiently large payload, it is possible to overflow the stack buffer, corrupt the stack frame and control execution. An attacker may use this to circumvent Secure Boot protections.",
