	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "A use-after-free flaw was found in D-Bus before version 1.12.20 when a system has multiple usernames sharing the same UID. When a set of policy rules references these usernames, D-Bus may free some memory in the heap, which is still used by data structures necessary for the other usernames sharing the UID, possibly leading to a crash or other undefined behaviors.",
