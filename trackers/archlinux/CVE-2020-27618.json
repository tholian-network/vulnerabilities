	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "A flaw was found in glibc up to version 2.32. If an attacker provides the iconv function with invalid multi-byte input sequences in IBM1364, IBM1371, IBM1388, IBM1390, IBM1399 encodings, it fails to advance the input state, which could lead to an infinite loop in applications, resulting in a denial of service. The issue is fixed in glibc version 2.33.",
