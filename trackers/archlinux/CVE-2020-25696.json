	"type": "arbitrary code execution",
	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "A security issue has been found in PostgreSQL before 12.5, where psql's \\gset allows overwriting specially treated variables. The \\gset meta-command, which sets psql variables based on query results, does not distinguish variables that control psql behavior. If an interactive psql session uses \\gset when querying a compromised server, the attacker can execute arbitrary code as the operating system account running psql. Using \\gset with a prefix not found among specially treated variables, e.g. any lowercase string, precludes the attack in an unpatched psql.",
