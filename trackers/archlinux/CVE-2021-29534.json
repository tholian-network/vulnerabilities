	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "A security issue has been found in TensorFlow before version 2.4.2. An attacker can trigger a denial of service via a `CHECK`-fail in `tf.raw_ops.SparseConcat`. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/b432a38fe0e1b4b904a6c222cbce794c39703e87/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_concat_op.cc#L76) takes the values specified in `shapes[0]` as dimensions for the output shape. The `TensorShape` constructor(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/6f9896890c4c703ae0a0845394086e2e1e523299/tensorflow/core/framework/tensor_shape.cc#L183-L188) uses a `CHECK` operation which triggers when `InitDims`(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/6f9896890c4c703ae0a0845394086e2e1e523299/tensorflow/core/framework/tensor_shape.cc#L212-L296) returns a non-OK status. This is a legacy implementation of the constructor and operations should use `BuildTensorShapeBase` or `AddDimWithStatus` to prevent `CHECK`-failures in the presence of overflows.",
