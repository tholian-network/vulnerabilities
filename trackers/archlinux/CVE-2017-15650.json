	"type": "arbitrary code execution",
	"severity": "Critical",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "A stack-based buffer overflow has been found in the DNS response parsing code of musl libc <= 1.1.16. When an application makes a request via getaddrinfo for both IPv4 and IPv6 results (AF_UNSPEC), an attacker who controls or can spoof the nameservers configured in resolv.conf can reply to both the A and AAAA queries with A results. Since A records are smaller than AAAA records, it's possible to fit more addresses than the precomputed bound, and a buffer overflow occurs.",
