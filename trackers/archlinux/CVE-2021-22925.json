	"description": "A security issue has been found in curl before version 7.78.0. curl supports the -t command line option, known as CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS in libcurl. This rarely used option is used to send variable=content pairs to TELNET servers. Due to flaw in the option parser for sending NEW_ENV variables, libcurl before version 7.78.0 could be made to pass on uninitialized data from a stack based buffer to the server. Therefore potentially revealing sensitive internal information to the server using a clear-text network protocol. This could happen because curl did not call and use sscanf() correctly when parsing the string provided by the application.\r\n\r\nThe previous curl security vulnerability CVE-2021-22898 is almost identical to this one but the fix was insufficient so this security vulnerability remained.",
