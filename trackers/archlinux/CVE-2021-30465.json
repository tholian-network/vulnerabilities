	"description": "runc 1.0.0-rc94 and earlier are vulnerable to a symlink exchange attack where an attacker with the ability to start containers using a custom volume configuration can request a seemingly-innocuous container configuration that results in the host filesystem being bind-mounted into the container (allowing for a container escape).",
