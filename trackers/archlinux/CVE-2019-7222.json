	"name": "CVE-2019-7222",
	"type": "information disclosure",
	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "An information leakage issue was found in the way Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor handled page fault exceptions while emulating instructions like VMXON, VMCLEAR, VMPTRLD, and VMWRITE with memory address as an operand. It occurs if the operand is a mmio address, as the returned exception object holds uninitialized stack memory contents. A guest user/process could use this flaw to leak host's stack memory contents to a guest.",
