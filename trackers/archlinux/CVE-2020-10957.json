	"description": "A NULL-pointer dereference issue has been found in Dovecot before 2.3.10.1 in the lmtp/submission component. A client can crash the server by sending a NOOP command with an invalid string parameter. This occurs particularly for a parameter that doesn't start with a double quote. This applies to all SMTP services, including submission-login, which makes it possible to crash the submission service without authentication.",
