	"name": "CVE-2016-9013",
	"type": "authentication bypass",
	"severity": "High",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "When running tests with an Oracle database, Django creates a temporary database user. In older versions, if a password isn't manually specified in the database settings TEST dictionary, a hardcoded password is used. This could allow an attacker with network access to the database server to connect.\n\nThis user is usually dropped after the test suite completes, but not when using the manage.py test --keepdb option or if the user has an active session (such as an attacker's connection).",
