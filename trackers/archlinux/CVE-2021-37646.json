	"type": "incorrect calculation",
	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "In TensorFlow before version 2.6.0 the implementation of tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams is vulnerable to an integer overflow issue caused by converting a signed integer value to an unsigned one and then allocating memory based on this value. The implementation calls reserve on a tstring with a value that sometimes can be negative if user supplies negative ngram_widths. The reserve method calls TF_TString_Reserve which has an unsigned long argument for the size of the buffer. Hence, the implicit conversion transforms the negative value to a large integer.",
