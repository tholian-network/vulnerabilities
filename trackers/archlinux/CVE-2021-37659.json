	"type": "information disclosure",
	"severity": "Low",
	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "In TensorFlow before version 2.6.0 an attacker can cause undefined behavior via binding a reference to null pointer in all binary cwise operations that don't require broadcasting (e.g., gradients of binary cwise operations). The implementation assumes that the two inputs have exactly the same number of elements but does not check that. Hence, when the eigen functor executes it triggers heap OOB reads and undefined behavior due to binding to nullptr.",
