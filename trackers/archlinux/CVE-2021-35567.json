	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "A security issue has been found in OpenJDK before versions 8u312, 11.0.13 and 17.0.1 in the security-libs/java.security component. An easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via Kerberos to compromise OpenJDK. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in OpenJDK, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all OpenJDK accessible data.\r\n\r\nNote : This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a web service which supplies data to the APIs.",
