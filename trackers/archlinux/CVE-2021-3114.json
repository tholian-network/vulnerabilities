	"description": "A security issue was found in Go and fixed in versions 1.15.7 and 1.14.14. The P224() Curve implementation can in rare circumstances generate incorrect outputs, including returning invalid points from ScalarMult. The crypto/x509 and golang.org/x/crypto/ocsp (but not crypto/tls) packages support P-224 ECDSA keys, but they are not supported by publicly trusted certificate authorities. No other standard library or golang.org/x/crypto package supports or uses the P-224 curve.",
