	"notes": "compiling a Regexp from untrusted input is considered unsafe in general but this case is still considered a vulnerability. https://hackerone.com/piao?type=user shows the severity as high, the linked reference is not yet public, the ruby-lang post does not state a severity, why nvd assumes this to be critical is unclear as they seem to assume it to be remotely exploitable which suggests the use in a webapp but that should be a cve for the webapp instead"
