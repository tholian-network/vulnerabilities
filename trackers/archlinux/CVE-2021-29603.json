	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "A security issue has been found in TensorFlow before version 2.4.2. A specially crafted TFLite model could trigger an OOB write on heap in the TFLite implementation of `ArgMin`/`ArgMax`(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/102b211d892f3abc14f845a72047809b39cc65ab/tensorflow/lite/kernels/arg_min_max.cc#L52-L59). If `axis_value` is not a value between 0 and `NumDimensions(input)`, then the condition in the `if` is never true, so code writes past the last valid element of `output_dims->data`.",
