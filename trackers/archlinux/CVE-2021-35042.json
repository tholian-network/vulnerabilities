	"description": "A security issue has been found in Django before version 3.2.5. Unsanitized user input passed to QuerySet.order_by() could bypass intended column reference validation in path marked for deprecation resulting in a potential SQL injection even if a deprecation warning is emitted. As a mitigation the strict column reference validation was restored for the duration of the deprecation period.",
