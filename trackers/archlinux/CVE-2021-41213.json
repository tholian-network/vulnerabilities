{
	"name": "CVE-2021-41213",
	"type": "denial of service",
	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "In TensorFlow before version 2.6.1, the code behind tf.function API can be made to deadlock when two tf.function decorated Python functions are mutually recursive. This occurs due to using a non-reentrant Lock Python object. Loading any model which contains mutually recursive functions is vulnerable. An attacker can cause denial of service by causing users to load such models and calling a recursive tf.function, although this is not a frequent scenario.",
