	"description": "A security issue was found in ceph before version 15.2.12. In order to make the JWT token inaccessible through cross-site scripting (XSS), it was moved from localStorage to httpOnly Cookie (CVE-2020-27839). But token cookies are used in the body of the HTTP response for the documentation, which again makes it available to XSS.",
