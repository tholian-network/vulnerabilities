	"description": "A security issue has been found in FreeRDP before version 2.4.1. A malicious server might trigger out of bound writes in a connected client.\r\n\r\nConnections using GDI or SurfaceCommands to send graphics updates to the client might send 0 width/height or out of bound rectangles to trigger out of bound writes. With 0 width or heigth the memory allocation will be 0 but the missing bounds checks allow writing to the pointer at this (not allocated) region.",
