	"type": "information disclosure",
	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "A security issue was discovered in Kubernetes where actors that control the responses of MutatingWebhookConfiguration or ValidatingWebhookConfiguration requests are able to redirect kube-apiserver requests to private networks of the apiserver. If that user can view kube-apiserver logs when the log level is set to 10, they can view the redirected responses and headers in the logs.",

	"advisories": [],
	"references": [
		"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/104720"
	],
	"notes": "Workaround\r\n==========\r\n\r\nThis issue can be mitigated by not allowing kube-apiserver access to sensitive resources or networks, or to reduce the “-v” flag value to less than 10 and set the “--profiling” flag value to “false” (default value is “true”). Setting the profiling flag to “false” prevents users from dynamically modifying the kube-apiserver log level, and the flag value Webhook requests may still be redirected to private networks with a log level less than 10, but the response body will not be logged."
