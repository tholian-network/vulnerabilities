	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "In TensorFlow before version 2.6.1, the shape inference code for QuantizeV2 can trigger a read outside of bounds of heap allocated array. This occurs whenever axis is a negative value less than -1. In this case, we are accessing data before the start of a heap buffer. The code allows axis to be an optional argument (s would contain an error::NOT_FOUND error code). Otherwise, it assumes that axis is a valid index into the dimensions of the input tensor. If axis is less than -1 then this results in a heap OOB read.",
