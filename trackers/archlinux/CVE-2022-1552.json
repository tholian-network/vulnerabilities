	"description": "Autovacuum, REINDEX, CREATE INDEX, REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW, CLUSTER, and pg_amcheck made incomplete efforts to operate safely when a privileged user is maintaining another user's objects. Those commands activated relevant protections too late or not at all. An attacker having permission to create non-temp objects in at least one schema could execute arbitrary SQL functions under a superuser identity.",
