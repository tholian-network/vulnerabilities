	"severity": "High",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "In Nimble before version 0.13.0, \"nimble refresh\" fetches a list of Nimble packages over HTTPS without full verification of the SSL/TLS certificate due to the default setting of httpClient. An attacker able to perform man-in-the-middle (MitM) can deliver a modified package list containing malicious software packages. If the packages are installed and used the attack escalates to untrusted code execution.",
