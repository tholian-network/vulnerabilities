	"name": "CVE-2020-0548",
	"type": "information disclosure",
	"severity": "Low",
	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "A flaw was found in Intel processors where a local attacker is able to gain information about registers used for vector calculations by observing register states from other processes running on the system. This results in a race condition where store buffers, which were not cleared, could be read by another process or a CPU sibling. The highest threat from this vulnerability is data confidentiality where an attacker could read arbitrary data as it passes through the processor.",
