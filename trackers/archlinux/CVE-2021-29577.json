The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/d80ffba9702dc19d1fac74fc4b766b3fa1ee976b/tensorflow/core/kernels/pooling_ops_3d.cc#L376-L450) assumes that the `orig_input_shape` and `grad` tensors have similar first and last dimensions but does not check that this assumption is validated.",
