	"name": "CVE-2021-2388",
	"type": "arbitrary code execution",
	"severity": "High",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "A security issue has been found in the Hotspot component of OpenJDK versions 7u301, 8u291, 11.0.11 and 16.0.1. A difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise OpenJDK. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of OpenJDK.\r\n\r\nNote : This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator).",
