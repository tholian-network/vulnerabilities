	"name": "CVE-2021-22883",
	"type": "denial of service",
	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "Node.js before versions 15.10.0, 14.16.0, 12.21.0 and 10.24.0 is vulnerable to denial of service attacks when too many connection attempts with an 'unknownProtocol' are established. This leads to a leak of file descriptors. If a file descriptor limit is configured on the system, then the server is unable to accept new connections and prevent the process also from opening, e.g. a file. If no file descriptor limit is configured, then this lead to an excessive memory usage and cause the system to run out of memory.",
