	"name": "CVE-2021-41259",
	"type": "insufficient validation",
	"severity": "Low",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "In Nim, the uri.parseUri function which may be used to validate URIs accepts null bytes in the input URI. This behavior could be used to bypass URI validation. For example: parseUri(\"http://localhost\\0hello\").hostname is set to \"localhost\\0hello\". Additionally, httpclient.getContent accepts null bytes in the input URL and ignores any data after the first null byte. Example: getContent(\"http://localhost\\0hello\") makes a request to localhost:80. An attacker can use a null bytes to bypass the check and mount a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack.",
