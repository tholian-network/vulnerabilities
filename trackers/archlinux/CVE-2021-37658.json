	"type": "information disclosure",
	"severity": "Low",
	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "In TensorFlow before version 2.6.0 an attacker can cause undefined behavior via binding a reference to null pointer in all operations of type tf.raw_ops.MatrixSetDiagV*. The implementation has incomplete validation that the value of k is a valid tensor. There is a check that this value is either a scalar or a vector, but there is no check for the number of elements. If this is an empty tensor, then code that accesses the first element of the tensor is wrong.",
