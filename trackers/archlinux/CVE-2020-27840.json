	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "A security issue has been found in Samba before version 4.14.2.  A DN may be represented in string form with arbitrary amounts of space around the component values. These spaces are supposed to be ignored, but invalid DNs strings with spaces may instead cause a zero byte to be written into out-of-bounds memory.\r\n\r\nAn LDAP bind request can send a string DN as a username. This DN is necessarily parsed before the password is checked, so an attacker without real credentials can anonymously trigger this bug.\r\n\r\nThe location of zero byte is a negative offset relative to the location of a dynamically allocated heap buffer; the exact offset depends on the DN string. While it is possible for an attacker to cause non-fatal data corruption, usefully targeting this is likely to be difficult and the most likely outcome is a crash.\r\n\r\nThe affected parsing routine is widely used. LDAP bind is not the only way to trigger the bug remotely, though it appears to be the only unauthenticated method.",
