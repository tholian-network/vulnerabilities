	"type": "content spoofing",
	"severity": "Low",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "PuTTY before version 0.76 proceeds with establishing an SSH session even if it has never sent a substantive authentication response. This makes it easier for an attacker-controlled SSH server to present a later spoofed authentication prompt (that the attacker can use to capture credential data, and use that data for purposes that are undesired by the client user).",
