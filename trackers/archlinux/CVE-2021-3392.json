	"type": "arbitrary code execution",
	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "A use-after-free issue was found in the Megaraid emulator of the QEMU. It occurs while processing SCSI I/O requests because in case of an error mptsas_free_request() does not dequeue request object 'req' from a pending requests' queue. Which later gets processed resulting in the said use-after-free issue. A privileged guest user may use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host resulting in a denial of service scenario.",
