	"name": "CVE-2020-35517",
	"type": "privilege escalation",
	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "A potential host privilege escalation issue was found in the virtio-fs shared  file system daemon (virtiofsd) of the QEMU. Virtio-fs daemon shares the host directory tree with a guest VM. The said privilege escalation scenario may occur if a privileged guest user was to create device special file in the shared directory and use it to r/w access host devices. A privileged guest user may use this flaw to arbitrarily access (r/w) host files resulting in DoS scenario or may potentially escalate privileges on the host.",
