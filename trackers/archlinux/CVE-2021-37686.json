	"type": "denial of service",
	"severity": "High",
	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "In TensorFlow before version 2.6.0 the strided slice implementation in TFLite has a logic bug which can allow an attacker to trigger an infinite loop. This arises from newly introduced support for ellipsis in axis definition. An attacker can craft a model such that ellipsis_end_idx is smaller than i (e.g., always negative). In this case, the inner loop does not increase i and the continue statement causes execution to skip over the preincrement at the end of the outer loop.",
