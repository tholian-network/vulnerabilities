	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "curl doesn't parse the authority component of the URL correctly when the host name part ends with a '#' character, and could instead be tricked into connecting to a different host. This may have security implications if you for example use a URL parser that follows the RFC to check for allowed domains before using curl to request them.\n\nPassing in http://example.com#@evil.com/x.txt would wrongly make curl send a request to evil.com while your browser would connect to example.com given the same URL.\n\nThe problem exists for most protocol schemes.",
