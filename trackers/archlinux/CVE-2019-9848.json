	"description": "An issue has been found in LibreOffice before 6.2.5, where documents can specify that pre-installed scripts can be executed on various document events such as mouse-over, etc. LibreOffice is typically also bundled with LibreLogo, a programmable turtle vector graphics script, which can be manipulated into executing arbitrary python commands. By using the document event feature to trigger LibreLogo to execute python contained within a document a malicious document could be constructed which would execute arbitrary python commands silently without warning.\r\nIn the fixed versions, LibreLogo cannot be called from a document event handler.",
