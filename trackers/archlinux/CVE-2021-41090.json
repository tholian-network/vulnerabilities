	"description": "A security issue has been found in Grafana Agent before version 0.21.2. Some inline secrets are exposed in plaintext over the Grafana Agent HTTP server:\r\n\r\n- Inline secrets for metrics instance configs in the base YAML file are exposed at /-/config\r\n- Inline secrets for integrations are exposed at /-/config\r\n- Inline secrets for Consul ACL tokens and ETCD basic auth when configured for the scraping service at /-/config.\r\n- Inline secrets for the Kafka receiver for OpenTelemetry-Collector tracing at /-/config.\r\n- Inline secrets for metrics instance configs loaded from the scraping service are exposed at /agent/api/v1/configs/{name}.\r\n\r\nInline secrets will be exposed to anyone being able to reach these endpoints.\r\n\r\nSecrets found in these sections are used for:\r\n\r\n- Delivering metrics to a Prometheus Remote Write system\r\n- Authenticating against a system for discovering Prometheus targets\r\n- Authenticating against a system for collecting metrics (scrape_configs and integrations)\r\n- Authenticating against a Consul or ETCD for storing configurations to distribute in scraping service mode\r\n- Authenticating against Kafka for receiving traces\r\n\r\nNon-inlined secrets, such as *_file-based secrets, are not impacted by this vulnerability.",

	"notes": "Workaround\r\n==========\r\n\r\nTo mitigate the issue, use non-inline secrets where possible. Not all configuration options may have a non-inline equivalent.\r\n\r\nYou also may desire to restrict API access to Grafana Agent, with some combination of:\r\n\r\n- Restrict network interfaces Grafana Agent listens on through http_listen_address in the server block. 127.0.0.1 is the most restrictive, 0.0.0.0 is the default.\r\n- Configure Grafana Agent to use HTTPS with client authentication.\r\n- Use firewall rules to restrict external access to Grafana Agent's API."
