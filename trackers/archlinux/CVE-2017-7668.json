	"severity": "High",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "An out-of-bounds read has been found in Apache httpd < 2.4.26. The HTTP strict parsing changes added in 2.2.32 and 2.4.24 introduced a bug in token list parsing, which allows ap_find_token() to search past the end of its input string. By maliciously crafting a sequence of request headers, an attacker may be able to cause a segmentation fault, or to force ap_find_token() to return an incorrect value.",
