	"description": "A security issue has been found in pip before version 21.1. Maliciously formatted tags could be used to hijack a commit-based pin. Using the fact that all of unicode's whitespace characters were allowed as separators - which git allows as a part of a tag name - it is possible to force a different revision to be installed if an attacker gains access to the repository.",
