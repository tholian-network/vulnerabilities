	"description": "In Firefox before 68.0, when an inner window is reused, it does not consider the use of document.domain for cross-origin protections. If pages on different subdomains ever cooperatively use document.domain, then either page can abuse this to inject script into arbitrary pages on the other subdomain, even those that did not use document.domain to relax their origin security.",
