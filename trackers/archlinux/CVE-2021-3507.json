	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Local",

It could occur in fdctrl_transfer_handler() in hw/block/fdc.c while processing DMA read data transfers from the floppy drive to the guest system. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host resulting in a denial of service (DoS) scenario, or potential information leakage from the host memory.",
