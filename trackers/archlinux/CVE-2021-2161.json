	"type": "incorrect calculation",
	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "It was discovered that the implementation of ProcesBuilder in the Libraries component of OpenJDK on the Windows platform did not properly detect command arguments that were not quoted correctly. This could lead to manipulation of command arguments when executing processes with arguments from untrusted sources. This issue did not affect OpenJDK builds on the Linux platform. It is fixed in versions 16.0.1, 11.0.11, 8u291, and 7u301.",
