	"type": "certificate verification bypass",
	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "Incorrect length validation on gnutls's gnutls_ocsp_resp_check_crt method can allow an attacker to use a OCSP response for a different certificate (but from the same CA) to continue using a revoked certificate. This can happen if the serial from the revoked certificate is a prefix of the other one, and the additional bytes happen to be equal on the system doing the verification.",
