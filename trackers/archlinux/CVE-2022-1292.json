	"vector": "Unknown",
	"description": "The c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection.  This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed.  On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the rivileges of the script. Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool.",
