	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "A stack buffer overflow was found in xkbtext.c, which didn't handle xkb formatted string output safely due to a single shared static buffer. The fix introduces a ring of resizable buffers to avoid problems when strings end up longer than anticipated.\r\nThis vulnerability may potentially lead to privilege escalation when the xorg-server is running with root privileges.",
