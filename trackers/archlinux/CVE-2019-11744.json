	"type": "cross-site scripting",
	"severity": "High",
	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "A security issue has been found in Firefox before 69.0. Some HTML elements, such as <title> and <textarea>, can contain literal angle brackets without treating them as markup. It is possible to pass a literal closing tag to .innerHTML on these elements, and subsequent content after that will be parsed as if it were outside the tag. This can lead to XSS if a site does not filter user input as strictly for these elements as it does for other elements.",
