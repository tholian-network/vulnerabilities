	"severity": "Medium",
	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "A flaw was found in QEMU before version 5.2.0. An out-of-bounds read/write access issue was found in the USB OHCI controller emulator. The issue could occur while servicing transfer descriptors (TD), as OHCI controller derives variables 'start_addr', 'end_addr', and 'len' from values supplied by the host controller driver. The host controller driver may supply values such that using these variables leads to an out-of-bounds access issue leading to a guest user/process using this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host resulting in a denial of service (DoS) scenario. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.",
