	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "A security issue was found in the io-workqueue implementation in the Linux kernel before version 5.15. The kernel can panic when an improper cancellation operation triggers the submission of new io-uring operations during  a shortage of free space.   This allows a local user with permissions to execute io-uring requests to possible crash the system.",
