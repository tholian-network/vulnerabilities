	"description": "The mkdir procedure of GNU Guile, an implementation of the Scheme programming language, temporarily changed the process' umask to zero. During that time window, in a multithreaded application, other threads could end up creating files with insecure permissions. For example, mkdir without the optional mode argument would create directories as 0777.",
