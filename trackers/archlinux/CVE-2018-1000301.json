	"description": "curl >= 7.20.0 and < 7.60.0 can be tricked into reading data beyond the end of a heap based buffer used to store downloaded content.\r\nWhen servers send RTSP responses back to curl, the data starts out with a set of headers. curl parses that data to separate it into a number of headers to deal with those appropriately and to find the end of the headers that signal the start of the \"body\" part. The function that splits up the response into headers is called Curl_http_readwrite_headers() and in situations where it can't find a single header in the buffer, it might end up leaving a pointer pointing into the buffer instead of to the start of the buffer which then later on may lead to an out of buffer read when code assumes that pointer points to a full buffer size worth of memory to use.\r\nThis could potentially lead to information leakage but most likely a crash/denial of service for applications if a server triggers this flaw.",
