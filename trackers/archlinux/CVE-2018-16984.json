	"vector": "Remote",
	"description": "If an admin user has the change permission to the user model, only part of the password hash is displayed in the change form. Admin users with the view (but not change) permission to the user model were displayed the entire hash. While it's typically infeasible to reverse a strong password hash, if your site uses weaker password hashing algorithms such as MD5 or SHA1, it could be a problem.",
