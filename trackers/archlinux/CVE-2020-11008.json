	"description": "A vulnerability has been found in git before 2.26.2. With a crafted URL that contains a newline or empty host, or lacks a scheme, the credential helper machinery can be fooled into providing credential information that is not appropriate for the protocol in use and host being contacted.\r\n\r\nUnlike the vulnerability CVE-2020-5260 fixed in v2.26.1, the credentials are not for a host of the attacker's choosing; instead, they are for some unspecified host (based on how the configured credential helper handles an absent \"host\" parameter).\r\n\r\nThe attack has been made impossible by refusing to work with under-specified credential patterns.",
