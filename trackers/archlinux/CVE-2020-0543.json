	"type": "information disclosure",
	"severity": "High",
	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "A new domain bypass transient execution attack known as Special Register Buffer Data Sampling (SRBDS) has been found. This flaw allows data values from special internal registers to be leaked by an attacker able to execute code on any core of the CPU. An unprivileged, local attacker can use this flaw to infer values returned by affected instructions known to be commonly used during cryptographic operations that rely on uniqueness, secrecy, or both.",
