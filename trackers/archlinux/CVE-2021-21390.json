	"description": "In MinIO before version RELEASE.2021-03-17T02-33-02Z, there is a vulnerability which enables man-in-the-middle (MITM) modification of request bodies that are meant to have integrity guaranteed by chunk signatures. In a PUT request using the aws-chunked encoding, MinIO ordinarily verifies signatures at the end of a chunk. This check can be skipped if the client sends a false chunk size that is much greater than the actual data sent: the server accepts and completes the request without ever reaching the end of the chunk and thereby without ever checking the chunk signature. This is fixed in version RELEASE.2021-03-17T02-33-02Z.",

	"notes": "Workaround\r\n==========\r\n\r\nAs a workaround one can avoid using \"aws-chunked\" encoding-based chunk signature upload requests and instead use TLS. MinIO SDKs automatically disable chunked encoding signature when the server endpoint is configured with TLS."
