	"vector": "Local",
	"description": "fishProtocol::establishConnection in fish/fish.cpp in KDE kio-extras through 20.04.0 makes a cacheAuthentication call even if the user had not set the keepPassword option.  This may lead to unintended KWallet storage of the password.\r\n\r\nThis is considered a security issue by users who do not trust KWallet (e.g. because passwords can be read in KWalletManager, given physical access).",
