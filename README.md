# Tholian Vulnerabilities Database

This is the vulnerability database that's being generated by our proprietary Detective and Oversight system.

The data is generated in production mode, which implies that the [products](/product) and [vulnerabilities](/vulnerability)
are used to automatically classify incidents and mitigate package/dependency problems, either by an update
or by other strategic measurements.


## Limitations

GitHub forces its users to use Git LFS (Large File Storage), which means that this repository
would cost around 50$/month (not including traffic bandwidth) just for the sake of publishing the
data publicly. As there is no free plan for Open Source, future releases of this repository might
be only available in the [releases](https://github.com/tholian-network/vulnerabilities/releases).

In order to find out what is removed from this repository, take a look at the [.gitignore](/.gitignore) file.

Due to political concerns, this database dump currently does not contain the automatically generated
exploits and classifiers for each vulnerability. At a later point we might try to open source it, once
the Russian army stops trying to hack the EU infrastructure (which might also never happen).


## Missing Data

- [x] Cached OVAL data for various security trackers that exceed 100MB file size
- [x] Automatically generated pcap streams of incidents (to generate classifiers and exploits)
- [x] Automatically generated exploits (the `aggrevations` folder for each vulnerability)
- [x] Automatically generated classifiers (the `mitigations` folder for each vulnerability)
